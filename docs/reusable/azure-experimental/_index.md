:::caution Experimental

Currently, Azure support is experimental and is provided “as is” for open source users.

If you’d like to load data into Snowflake or Databricks hosted on Azure, consider [BDP Cloud](https://snowplow.io/pricing/) — our SaaS offering that already supports these destinations.

If you are interested in deploying [BDP Enterprise](https://snowplow.io/pricing/) (private SaaS with extra features, SLAs, etc) in your Azure account, you can join the waiting list by sending us an email at [info@snowplow.io](mailto:info@snowplow.io).
