Snowplow allows for a highly configurable cookie set up. This allows for you to create optimal first party tracking in a privacy-first world, including anonymous and cookieless tracking.

Below you'll find a flow chart to help you with your cookie configuration, guiding you through the configuration options for both your [Snowplow Collector](/docs/pipeline-components-and-applications/stream-collector/index.md) and the [Snowplow JavaScript Tracker](/docs//collecting-data/collecting-from-own-applications/javascript-trackers/index.md).
