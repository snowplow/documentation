description: A selection of useful SQL queries to run on the derived dbt unified package data
---


The [Snowplow Unified data model](/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-models/dbt-unified-data-model/index.md) enables analysts to more easily generate insights from their Snowplow data, without having to run potentially complicated, long-running and expensive queries over the raw event level data. This how-to guide is designed to give an inspiration of how the derived tables in the model (`views`, `sessions` and `users`) can be used to answer common web analytics questions. This guide is aimed at analysts using query tools (such as Redash, Metabase, Superset etc) to interrogate their Snowplow data, and to also highlight to other users how the Snowplow derived data can be used (potentially with SQL based BI tools such as Tableau, Looker, Power BI etc).

Most of these queries are relatively warehouse agnostic, however there may be small differences such the order of arguments in `date_trunc()` (which are reversed in BigQuery) or casting types you may need to edit. You will also need to substitute the relevant schema name into these queries.

In some cases, some of these queries can be merged to display multiple metrics or dimensions, making n-dimensional pivoting or slicing and dicing possible. 

## Page Views Table
### Top 10 Most Viewed Pages

```sql
SELECT
    page_urlpath,
    COUNT(DISTINCT view_id) AS page_views
