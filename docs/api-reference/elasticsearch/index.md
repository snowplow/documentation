If you are using [Enrich](/docs/api-reference/enrichment-components/index.md) to write enriched Snowplow events to one stream and bad events to another, you can use the Elasticsearch Loader to read events from either of those streams and write them to [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/). It works with either Kinesis or NSQ streams.

:::warning

We only offer this loader on AWS or as part of [Snowplow Mini](/docs/api-reference/snowplow-mini/index.md).

## What the data looks like

There are a few changes compared to the [standard structure of Snowplow data](/docs/fundamentals/canonical-event/index.md).

### Boolean fields reformatted

All boolean fields like `br_features_java` are normally either `"0"` or `"1"`. In Elasticsearch, these values are converted to `false` and `true`.

### New `geo_location` field

The `geo_latitude` and `geo_longitude` fields are combined into a single `geo_location` field of Elasticsearch's ["geo_point" type](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/geo-point.html).

### Self-describing events

Each [self-describing event](/docs/fundamentals/events/index.md#self-describing-events) gets its own field (same [naming rules](/docs/destinations/warehouses-lakes/schemas-in-warehouse/index.md?warehouse=snowflake#location) as for Snowflake). For example:

```json
{
  "unstruct_com_snowplowanalytics_snowplow_link_click_1": {
    "targetUrl": "http://snowplow.io",
    "elementId": "action",
    "elementClasses": [],
    "elementTarget": ""
  }
}
```

### Entities

Each [entity](/docs/fundamentals/entities/index.md) type attached to the event gets its own field (same [naming rules](/docs/destinations/warehouses-lakes/schemas-in-warehouse/index.md?warehouse=snowflake#location) as for Snowflake). The field contains an array with the data for all entities of the given type. For example:

```json
{
  "contexts_com_acme_user_1": [
    {
      "name": "Alice"
    }
  ],
  "contexts_com_acme_product_1": [
    {
      "name": "Apple"
    },
    {
      "name": "Orange"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Setup guide

### Configuring Elasticsearch

#### Getting started

First off, install and set up Elasticsearch. For more information, check out the [installation guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/_installation.html) for installation information and [Supported versions of OpenSearch and Elasticsearch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/what-is.html#choosing-version) for the latest information of ElasticSearch/OpenSearch supported versions by AWS.

:::note Supported Versions

We support ElasticSearch v6.x and v7.x. We also support OpenSearch v1.x and v2.x. We do not support ElasticSearch v8.x currently.

:::

#### Raising the file limit

Elasticsearch keeps a lot of files open simultaneously so you will need to increase the maximum number of files a user can have open. To do this:

<CodeBlock language="bash">{
`sudo vim /etc/security/limits.conf
`}</CodeBlock>

Append the following lines to the file:

<CodeBlock language="bash">{
`{{USERNAME}} soft nofile 32000
{{USERNAME}} hard nofile 32000
`}</CodeBlock>

Where `{{USERNAME}}` is the name of the user running Elasticsearch. You will need to logout and restart Elasticsearch before the new file limit takes effect.

To check that this new limit has taken effect you can run the following command from the terminal:

<CodeBlock language="bash">{
`curl localhost:9200/_nodes/process?pretty
`}</CodeBlock>

If the `max_file_descriptors` equals 32000 it is running with the new limit.

#### Defining the mapping

Use the following request to create the mapping with Elasticsearch 7+:

<CodeBlock language="bash">{
`curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/snowplow' -d '{
    "settings": {
        "analysis": {
            "analyzer": {
                "default": {
                    "type": "keyword"
                }
            }
        }
    },
    "mappings": {
        "properties": {
            "geo_location": {
                "type": "geo_point"
            }
        }
    }
}'
`}</CodeBlock>

Note that Elasticsearch 7+ [no longer uses mapping types](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/removal-of-types.html). If you have an older version, you might need to include mapping types in the above snippet.

This initialization sets the default analyzer to "keyword". This means that string fields will not be split into separate tokens for the purposes of searching. This saves space and ensures that URL fields are handled correctly.

If you want to tokenize specific string fields, you can change the "properties" field in the mapping like this:

<CodeBlock language="bash">{
`curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/snowplow' -d '{
    "settings": {
        "analysis": {
            "analyzer": {
                "default": {
                    "type": "keyword"
                }
            }
        }
    },
    "mappings": {
        "properties": {
            "geo_location": {
                "type": "geo_point"
            },
            "field_to_tokenize": {
                "type": "string",
                "analyzer": "english"
            }
        }
    }
}'
`}</CodeBlock>

### Installing the Elasticsearch Loader

The Elasticsearch Loader is published on Docker Hub:

<CodeBlock language="bash">{
`docker pull snowplow/snowplow-elasticsearch-loader:${versions.esLoader}
`}</CodeBlock>

The container can be run with the following command:

<CodeBlock language="bash">{
`docker run \\
  -v /path/to/config.hocon:/snowplow/config.hocon \\
  snowplow/snowplow-elasticsearch-loader:${versions.esLoader} \\
  --config /snowplow/config.hocon
`}</CodeBlock>

Alternatively you can download and run a [jar file from the github release](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-elasticsearch-loader/releases):

<CodeBlock language="bash">{
`java -jar snowplow-elasticsearch-loader-${versions.esLoader}.jar --config /path/to/config.hocon
`}</CodeBlock>
