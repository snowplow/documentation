## Usage

### trackConsentAllow

To track the complete acceptance of a user consent prompt, you can use the `trackConsentAllow` method with the following attributes:

```js
window.snowplow("trackConsentAllow:{trackerName}", {
    consentScopes: ["necessary", "marketing", "personalization"],
    basisForProcessing: "consent",
    consentUrl: "https://www.example.com/",
    consentVersion: "1.0",
    domainsApplied: ["https://www.example.com/"],
    gdprApplies: true
});
```

### trackConsentSelected

To track the specific selection of scopes of a user consent preferences, you can use the `trackConsentSelected` method with the following attributes:

```js
window.snowplow("trackConsentSelected:{trackerName}", {
    consentScopes: ["necessary", "marketing", "personalization"],
    basisForProcessing: "consent",
    consentUrl: "https://www.example.com/",
    consentVersion: "1.0",
    domainsApplied: ["https://www.example.com/"],
    gdprApplies: true
});
```

### trackConsentPending

Some consent management platform installations, allow the user to take website actions or/and navigating to other pages without accepting the consent prompt. To track the unconfirmed selection of user consent, you can use the `trackConsentPending` method with the following attributes:

```js
window.snowplow("trackConsentPending:{trackerName}", {
    consentScopes: ["necessary", "marketing", "personalization"],
    basisForProcessing: "consent",
    consentUrl: "https://www.example.com/",
    consentVersion: "1.0",
    domainsApplied: ["https://www.example.com/"],
    gdprApplies: true
});
```

### trackConsentImplicit

Some consent management platforms have a configuration which allows the setting of consent implicitly after a set of user interactions like clicks, scroll etc. To track the implicit selection of a user consent, you can use the `trackConsentImplicit` method with the following attributes:

```js
window.snowplow("trackConsentImplicit:{trackerName}", {
    consentScopes: ["necessary", "marketing", "personalization"],
    basisForProcessing: "consent",
    consentUrl: "https://www.example.com/",
    consentVersion: "1.0",
    domainsApplied: ["https://www.example.com/"],
    gdprApplies: true
});
```

### trackConsentDeny

To track the complete denial of a user consent, you can use the `trackConsentDeny` method with the following attributes:

```js
window.snowplow("trackConsentDeny:{trackerName}", {
    consentScopes: ["necessary"],
    basisForProcessing: "consent",
    consentUrl: "https://www.example.com/",
    consentVersion: "1.0",
    domainsApplied: ["https://www.example.com/"],
    gdprApplies: true
});
```

### trackConsentExpired

To track the expiration of a user consent, you can use the `trackConsentExpired` method with the following attributes:

```js
window.snowplow("trackConsentExpired:{trackerName}", {
    consentScopes: ["necessary", "marketing", "personalization"],
    basisForProcessing: "consent",
    consentUrl: "https://www.example.com/",
    consentVersion: "1.0",
    domainsApplied: ["https://www.example.com/"],
    gdprApplies: true
});
```

### trackConsentWithdrawn

To track the withdrawal of a user consent, you can use the `trackConsentWithdrawn` method with the following attributes:

```js
window.snowplow("trackConsentWithdrawn:{trackerName}", {
    consentScopes: ["necessary", "marketing", "personalization"],
    basisForProcessing: "consent",
    consentUrl: "https://www.example.com/",
    consentVersion: "1.0",
    domainsApplied: ["https://www.example.com/"],
    gdprApplies: true
});
```

### trackCmpVisible

Consent management platform banners are an important part of a website’s first impression and performance. Snowplow provides a way to track what we call `elapsedTime`, which is the timestamp of the consent management platform banner becoming visible on the user’s screen.

```js
window.snowplow("trackCmpVisible:{trackerName}", {
    /* Using the performance.now API to retrieve the elapsed time from the page navigation. */
    elapsedTime: performance.now(),
});
```
