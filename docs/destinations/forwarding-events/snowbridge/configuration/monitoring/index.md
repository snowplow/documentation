# Monitoring Configuration

## Stats and metrics

Snowbridge comes with configurable logging, [pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof) profiling, [statsD](https://www.datadoghq.com/statsd-monitoring) statistics and [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) integrations to ensure that you know whatâ€™s going on.

### Logging

Use the log_level parameter to specify the log level.

```hcl reference
https://github.com/snowplow/snowbridge/blob/master/assets/docs/configuration/monitoring/log-level-example.hcl
```

### Sentry Configuration

```hcl reference
https://github.com/snowplow/snowbridge/blob/master/assets/docs/configuration/monitoring/sentry-example.hcl
```
### StatsD stats receiver 

```hcl reference
https://github.com/snowplow/snowbridge/blob/master/assets/docs/configuration/monitoring/statsd-example.hcl
```

Snowbridge sends the following metrics to statsd:

| Metric                   | Definitions                                                                                                                                             |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `target_success`         | Events successfully sent to the target.                                                                                                                     |
| `target_failed`          | Events which failed to reach the target, after 5 retries. Will be retried later.                                                                        |
| `message_filtered`       | Events filtered out via transformation.                                                                                                                 |
| `failure_target_success` | Events we could not send to the target, which are not retryable, successfully sent to the failure target.                             |
| `failure_target_failed`  | Events we could not send to the target, which are not retryable, which we failed to send to the failure target. In this scenario, Snowbridge will crash. |
| `min_processing_latency` | Min time between entering Snowbridge and write to target/failure target.                                                                                |
