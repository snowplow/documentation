## Conclusion

Congratulations on completing the tutorial on setting up an abandoned browse tracking and re-engagement system using Snowplow, Snowflake, and Census! Here's a summary of what you've learned and achieved:

## Summary of achievements

1. **Tracking setup**: You have successfully implemented product view and engagement tracking using Snowplow's JavaScript tracker. This includes setting up page view, time spent, and add-to-cart tracking.

2. **Data modeling**: You have learned how to model your data to identify users who have shown interest in products but have not completed a purchase. This involved writing SQL queries to aggregate and analyze user behavior data, including tracking successful winback campaigns through URL parameters.

3. **Reverse ETL**: You have set up a reverse ETL workflow using Census to sync your modeled data to a marketing automation platform like Braze. This enables you to create targeted re-engagement campaigns.

4. **Campaign creation**: You have created and configured an abandoned browse email campaign in Braze, utilizing personalized content and tracking parameters to re-engage users, drive conversions, and measure campaign success.

## Recommended next steps

- **Expand tracking**: Extend your tracking setup to include additional user interactions, checkout steps, and campaign success metrics to create a more comprehensive view of user behavior and marketing effectiveness. You can follow our [ecommerce accelerator](https://docs.snowplow.io/accelerators/ecommerce) to learn more.

- **Advanced segmentation**: Use the data collected to create more advanced audience segments, such as users with high engagement but no purchase, or users who frequently view specific product categories.

- **A/B testing**: Implement A/B testing for different campaign elements, such as subject lines, send times, and content layouts, to identify what resonates best with your audience.

- **Personalization**: Enhance your campaigns with more personalized content, such as product recommendations based on browsing history or dynamic pricing offers.

- **Integration with other tools**: Consider integrating additional tools and platforms, such as CRM systems, to enrich your data with the customer's name and other data to improve campaign effectiveness.

By following these steps, you can continue to refine and expand your abandoned browse tracking and re-engagement system, ultimately driving higher conversion rates and improving customer engagement.
