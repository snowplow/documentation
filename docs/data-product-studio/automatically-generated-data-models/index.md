This feature lets you **generate Data Models directly from a Data Product**, allowing you to automatically generate optimised, easy-to-query data models from your data product that is ready for analysis, BI-tools, or reverse ETL use cases. Analysts and Engineers are able to create data models directly from the Snowplow Console through an easy to follow workflow and use them directly in their data warehouse or integrated into a dbt project. The autogenerated data models filter for only the relevant events whilst flattening your event and entity data structures into a column for each property.

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Flexible Inclusion of Events and Entities
- Include **all** or a **subset** of event specifications or entities.
- Choose exactly which **out-of-the-box columns** to include in the model.
These two features make it possible to create data models as fine-grained and targeted as required, providing you with full control over the level of detail.

### 2. Automatic Data Flattening
To create a **clean, wide table**, the tool automatically flattens data structures into individual columns.

**How flattening works:**
- **Event Data Structures** → All selected event data structure properties are flattened into their own columns.
- **Entities** → Flattening depends on cardinality:
  - **Single entities** (e.g., `user`) → Flattened into separate columns, e.g., `user_id`, `user_email`.
  - **Multiple entities** (e.g., arrays like `products`) → Stored as a single array column, which you can **unnest later**.

### 3. Event Specification Inference
The system determines which events to include in the final data model through **two distinct approaches**:

**Using Snowtype:**
- Generated data models are **automatically filtered** to event specification IDs added by Snowtype.
- Guarantees that **all events were sent with the intent** to implement this Data Product.
- Ensures **high data quality** and tracking consistency.

**Not Using Snowtype:**
- Generated data models include **all rows matching** the Data Product definition.
- Uses **"best effort" matching** based on events, entities, cardinalities, and rules.
- May include some **unintended events** but allows access to **historical data**.
- Requires **no adjustments** to existing tracking implementations.

### 4. Deployment Options
Choose between two generation methods:

- **View** → Best for lightweight use cases when you need **immediate access to data** with minimal setup.
- **Incremental dbt Model** → Ideal for production pipelines when you want to **materialize data efficiently** and integrate it into existing **dbt projects**.

## Use Cases

### **Use Case 1 — Quick Data Exploration**
**Scenario:**  
A developer needs to explore event-level data to **validate tracking** or analyze **user behavior**.

**How the Feature Helps:**
- Generate a lightweight **View** directly from a Data Product.
- Automatically flatten events and entities for easier querying.
- Select only relevant event specifications to avoid noise.

**Outcome:**  
Immediate access to a **clean, queryable table** without manual setup — enabling faster debugging and validation.

### **Use Case 2 — Production-Ready Data Models**
**Scenario:**  
A data engineer wants to integrate curated event data into an **existing dbt project** to power analytics dashboards.

**How the Feature Helps:**
- Create an **incremental dbt model** directly from the Data Product.
- Select only the **necessary events and entities** for optimal performance.
- Ensure **schema consistency** by aligning models with event specifications.
- Minimize integration errors and streamline analytics workflows.

**Outcome:**  
Seamless integration of **modeled event data** into production pipelines — ensuring **scalability, accuracy, and maintainability**.
