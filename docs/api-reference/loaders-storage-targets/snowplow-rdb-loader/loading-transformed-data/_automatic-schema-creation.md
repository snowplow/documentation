The `events` table and the database schema will be created automatically by the loader. You can [configure](/docs/api-reference/loaders-storage-targets/snowplow-rdb-loader/rdb-loader-configuration-reference/index.md) the name of the database schema with the `storage.schema` config field. The table name (`events`) can’t be changed.

<p>Keep in mind that the {props.name} Loader database user needs to have permissions to create schemas on the given database to be able to perform this operation. Check <a href={props.grantDocs}>this page</a> for more information about granting privileges in {props.name}. You can also create the schema manually if you prefer.</p>
