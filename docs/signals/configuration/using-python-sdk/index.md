The pages in this section describe how to use the [Signals Python SDK](https://github.com/snowplow-incubator/snowplow-signals-sdk) to define attribute groups, services, and interventions.

You must first deploy Signals using the self-serve process in Console, under the **Signals** section. After deployment, you'll have access to the Signals API URL needed for Python SDK usage.

To use the Python SDK, first choose where to store your Signals configurations. We recommend creating a new repository. The easiest way to use the SDK is within a Jupyter notebook.

Within your notebook, install the SDK.

```bash
pip install snowplow-signals
```

Once installed, you can start to define your configuration components. To test or apply your configuration, or retrieve calculated attributes from the Profiles Store, you'll need to connect to your Signals deployment.

### Required credentials

To connect to Signals, you will need 4 values:

| Value           | Description                             | Where to get it                 | Format                            |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Signals API URL | The API URL for your Signals deployment | Provided by Snowplow            | `https://{{UUID}}.svc.snplow.net` |
| API key         | A Snowplow API key                      | Generated by you in BDP Console | UUID                              |
| API key ID      | A Snowplow API key ID                   | Generated by you in BDP Console | UUID                              |
| Organization ID | Your Snowplow organization ID           | Part of your BDP Console URL    | UUID                              |

You can find your Organization ID [on the **Manage organization** page](https://console.snowplowanalytics.com/settings) in Console. Follow the instructions in [Account management](/docs/account-management/index.md) to generate your API key and key ID.

Add these four tokens to your environment or notebook secrets.

### Connecting to Signals

Create a `Signals` object by passing in the required values.

```python
from snowplow_signals import Signals

sp_signals = Signals(
    api_url=SP_API_URL,
    api_key=SP_API_KEY,
    api_key_id=SP_API_KEY_ID,
    org_id=SP_ORG_ID,
)
```

The created `Signals` object has the following methods:

| Method                   | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apply`                  | Registers the provided objects with Signals                                 |
| `test`                   | Tests an attribute group against the atomic events table                    |
| `get_attribute_group`    | Retrieves an attribute group from the Profiles Store                        |
| `get_service_attributes` | Retrieves attributes for a specific service from the Profiles Store         |
| `get_attributes`         | Retrieves attributes for a specific attribute group from the Profiles Store |

Check out the [attribute groups](/docs/signals/configuration/using-python-sdk/attribute-groups/index.md), [services](/docs/signals/configuration/using-python-sdk/services/index.md), and [interventions](/docs/signals/configuration/using-python-sdk/index.md) pages to learn how to configure them programmatically.
