## Collector URL (Required)

Set this to the URL of your Snowplow Collector you wish to send events to

## Cookies Settings

If you have configured your Snowplow collector to have different cookie details, you should ensure they match here.

### Name (Required)

This value must match the value of your Collector cookie name, this will allow the Snowplow Tag to find and return your Collector Cookie back to your users browser.

### Override Cookie Properties

If you'd like to overwrite your collectors cookie settings you can do that here.

#### Domain Override

To return a cookie with a different domain value than your collector, you can override it to another string here. "auto" will ensure the value is unchanged.

#### Path Override

This will override the path value of the cookie.

#### SameSite Override

This will override the SameSite flag on the cookie.

#### Expiration Override in Seconds

Allows the expiration time of the cookie to be altered. This value is in seconds, and defaults to 63072000 (2 years).

#### HttpOnly

Overwrites the HttpOnly flag on the cookie. Will be `true` if enabled, or `false` if disabled.

#### Secure

Overwrites the Secure flag on the cookie. Will be `true` if enabled, or `false` if disabled. Setting this to `false` and `SameSite` to `None` will prevent browsers from being able to store the cookie.

## Advanced Event Settings

### Define events to be sent as Snowplow Self-Describing Events

Enable this to allow custom self-describing event definitions.

#### Event Name to Schema

A table of the events (event names and corresponding schemas) to be tracked as custom self-describing Snowplow events.

Add events which you would like to capture and convert into Self Describing Events. The `Event Name` should equal the Clients `event_name` property, if this is found when the Snowplow Tag fires, this tag will create a Self Describing Event using the specified schema.

#### Event Definitions

A table of definitions for self-describing data properties. Each row maps a single data property of a custom self-describing Snowplow event to its value.

For each Event, you can also read properties off the client event object and add them as properties to the Self Describing Event.

### Base64 encoding

Whether to encode the custom self-describing event data in base64.

### Platform identifier

## Logs Settings

_(Available since v0.3.0)_

Through the Logs Settings you can control the logging behaviour of the Snowplow Tag. The available options are:

- `Do not log`: This option allows you to completely disable logging. No logs will be generated by the Tag.
- `Log to console during debug and preview`: This option enables logging only in debug and preview containers. This is the default option.
- `Always`: This option enables logging regardless of container mode.

_Note_: Please take into consideration that the logs generated may contain event data.

The logs generated by the Snowplow GTM-SS Tag are standardized JSON strings.  
The standard log properties are:

```
{
    "Name": "Snowplow"  // the name of the tag
    "Type": "Message"   // the type of log (one of "Message", "Request", "Response")
    "TraceId": "xxx"    // the "trace-id" header if exists
    "EventName" "xxx"   // the name of the event the tag fired at
}
```

Depending on the type of log, additional properties are logged:

<table><tbody><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center"><strong>Type of log</strong></td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center"><strong>Additional information</strong></td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Message</td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">"Message"</td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Request</td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">"RequestMethod", "RequestUrl", "RequestHeaders", "RequestBody"</td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Response</td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">"ResponseStatusCode", "ResponseHeaders", "ResponseBody"</td></tr></tbody></table>
