The pages in this section describe how to use the [Signals Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/snowplow-signals/) to define attribute groups and services. See the [interventions section](/docs/signals/define-interventions/index.md) to learn how to [define interventions](/docs/signals/define-interventions/using-python-sdk/index.md) using the SDK.

Start by [connecting to Signals](/docs/signals/connection/index.md) to create a `Signals` object. You'll need this connection to publish configurations to Signals.

Check out the [attribute groups](/docs/signals/define-attributes/using-python-sdk/attribute-groups/index.md) and [services](/docs/signals/define-attributes/using-python-sdk/services/index.md) pages to learn how to configure them programmatically.
