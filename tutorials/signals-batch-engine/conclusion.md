In this tutorial you've learned how to calculate attributes from your warehouse data, and apply them to Signals.

This is the process workflow:
* Define batch attribute group configurations and apply them to Signals
* Initialize dbt projects
* Generate models
* Configure the projects with dbt
* Create tables by running the models
* Connect the tables to Signals by syncing

Supported warehouses:
* Snowflake
* BigQuery
