To get started with Snowplow CDI Private Managed Cloud, follow the **Getting Started** steps in [Snowplow Console](https://console.snowplowanalytics.com/getting-started). You will receive an account as part of your onboarding.

The Getting Started steps will guide you through setting up your cloud environment. You can also find the instructions here:
* [AWS Setup Guide](/docs/get-started/private-managed-cloud/setup-guide-aws/index.md)
* [Azure Setup Guide](/docs/get-started/private-managed-cloud/setup-guide-azure/index.md)
* [GCP Setup Guide](/docs/get-started/private-managed-cloud/setup-guide-gcp/index.md)

Once you've set up your cloud environment, go ahead and [request a new pipeline](https://console.snowplowanalytics.com/pipelines/azure/new) in Console.

If you have a Snowplow CDI Cloud account, you don't need to worry about cloud configuration.
