# Introduction

BDP Cloud is a hosted and lightweight version of [Snowplow](https://snowplow.io), designed to get your organization up and running and delivering value from behavioural data as quickly as possible. It enables you to create rich and well-structured data to power your advanced analytics and AI use cases.

## How does BDP Cloud differ from BDP Enterprise?
    
BDP Cloud differs from Snowplow BDP Enterprise in the following ways:

- It is hosted by Snowplow rather than in your own cloud account, for teams seeking a turn-key managed solution
- It has an event cap of up to 80m events per month
- You can load your data to your self-hosted Snowflake, Redshift, or Databricks

For more details, see our [feature comparison page](/docs/feature-comparison/index.md).

## Where is the Snowplow pipeline hosted?
    
All data processed and collected with Snowplow BDP Cloud is undertaken within Snowplowâ€™s own cloud account (AWS `eu-central-1` region). Data is stored in Snowplowâ€™s cloud account for 7 days to provide resilience against potential failures.
