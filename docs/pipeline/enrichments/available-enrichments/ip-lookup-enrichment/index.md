This enrichment uses [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-databases) databases to look up useful data based on the IP address collected by your Snowplow tracker(s).

When a user browses your site or app their IP address is collected. MaxMind maintains databases of additional points of information like geographic location, second level domain names (acme.com), Internet Service Provider, organization name and several other data points publicly associated with a given IP address.

The IP lookup enrichment uses MaxMind databases in order to take the IP address collected and add additional data points to every event generated by the user with a given IP address.

Some of the databases MaxMind maintains require a commercial subscription with MaxMind.

## Setting up this Enrichment

### 1. Decide which databases you’d like to use and download them

MaxMind offers a free tier and a paid tier of databases, which can be used with Snowplow.

From the free tier you can provide two databases to Snowplow:

- [GeoLite2 City Database](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite2-free-geolocation-data/), which contains geographic information (e.g. country) by IP address
- [GeoLite2 ASN Database](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/docs/databases/asn/), which contains autonomous system numbers by IP address

From the paid tier you can provide four databases to Snowplow:

- [GeoIP2 City](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-city?rld=snowplow), which also contains geographic information, but with more precision and coverage than the GeoLite2 City Database
- [GeoIP2 ISP](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-isp-database?rld=snowplow), which contains information about the ISP serving that IP
- [GeoIP2 Domain](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-domain-name-database?rld=snowplow), which contains information about the domain at that IP address
- [GeoIP2 Connection Type](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-connection-type-database?rld=snowplow), which contains information about the connection type at that IP address.

You need to decide which of the different Maxmind databases listed above you wish to enrich your data with, download the .mmdb files and then setup the enrichment configuration accordingly.

### 2. Upload the databases to a location on your cloud

Once downloaded, take the .mmdb file(s) and upload them to a location on your cloud:

- Amazon S3 (if running Snowplow on AWS) e.g. s3://my-private-bucket/third-party/maxmind
- Google Cloud Storage (if running Snowplow on GCS) e.g. gs://my-private-bucket/third-party/maxmind

When the database(s) need updating in future you can simply download the latest version and overwrite this file in your storage.

MaxMind also offer a method to [download and update their databases programmatically](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoipupdate/).

### 3. Configure the enrichment for your pipeline

```mdx-code-block
import TestingWithMicro from "@site/docs/reusable/test-enrichment-with-micro/_index.md"
import XForwardedForPlugin from "@site/docs/reusable/x-forwarded-for-plugin/_index.md"
```

<TestingWithMicro>

Note that to test this enrichment, you will need events with realistic IP addresses (not local ones like `192.168.0.42`).

<XForwardedForPlugin/>

Alternatively, you can [set up Micro to receive external IP addresses](/docs/testing/snowplow-micro/remote-usage/index.md#exposing-micro-via-a-public-domain-name).

</TestingWithMicro>

There are five possible fields you can add to the “parameters” section of the enrichment configuration JSON: “geo”, “isp”, “domain”, “connectionType”, and “asn”:

- The `database` field contains the name of the MaxMind database file.
- The `uri` field contains the URI of the bucket in which the database file is found. This can have either `http:` or `s3:` or `gs:` as the scheme and must not end with a trailing slash.

It is important to note that accepted database filenames are the strings which are allowed in the `database` subfield. If the file name you provide is not one of these, the enrichment JSON will fail validation.

| ENRICHMENT PARAMETER | VALID DATABASE NAMES                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `geo`                | "GeoLite2-City.mmdb" (free)  "GeoIP2-City.mmdb" (paid) |
| `isp`                | "GeoIP2-ISP.mmdb"                                      |
| `domain`             | "GeoIP2-Domain.mmdb"                                   |
| `connectionType`     | "GeoIP2-Connection-Type.mmdb"                          |
| `asn`                | "GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb"                                    |

### Configuration

- [Schema](https://github.com/snowplow/iglu-central/blob/master/schemas/com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow/ip_lookups/jsonschema/2-0-1)
- [Example](https://github.com/snowplow/enrich/blob/master/config/enrichments/ip_lookups.json)

#### Example minimal configuration

##### On AWS

```json
{
    "schema": "iglu:com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow/ip_lookups/jsonschema/2-0-1",
    "data": {
        "name": "ip_lookups",
        "vendor": "com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow",
        "enabled": true,
        "parameters": {
            "geo": {
                "database": "GeoLite2-City.mmdb",
                "uri": "s3://my-private-bucket/third-party/maxmind"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

##### On GCS

```json
{
    "schema": "iglu:com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow/ip_lookups/jsonschema/2-0-1",
    "data": {
        "name": "ip_lookups",
        "vendor": "com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow",
        "enabled": true,
        "parameters": {
            "geo": {
                "database": "GeoLite2-City.mmdb",
                "uri": "gs://my-private-bucket/third-party/maxmind"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In the configurations above, we are enabling this enrichment to take all IP addresses from each event and do a lookup against the GeoLite2-City.mmdb.

The parameters to set start with the type of MaxMind database we are accessing (in this case the “geo” type). Then we specify the name of the database file, and the URI it’s available at.

When configuring the enrichment you will replace the following string `my-private-bucket/third-party/maxmind` with the path to your hosted database.

#### Example full configuration

To extend this enrichment for the additional databases offered by Maxmind we would simply repeat the process for the other databases:

##### On AWS

```json
{
    "schema": "iglu:com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow/ip_lookups/jsonschema/2-0-1",
    "data": {
        "name": "ip_lookups",
        "vendor": "com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow",
        "enabled": true,
        "parameters": {
            "geo": {
                "database": "GeoIP2-City.mmdb",
                "uri": "s3://my-private-bucket/third-party/maxmind"
            },
            "isp": {
                "database": "GeoIP2-ISP.mmdb",
                "uri": "s3://my-private-bucket/third-party/maxmind"
            },
            "domain": {
                "database": "GeoIP2-Domain.mmdb",
                "uri": "s3://my-private-bucket/third-party/maxmind"
            },
            "connectionType": {
                "database": "GeoIP2-Connection-Type.mmdb",
                "uri": "s3://my-private-bucket/third-party/maxmind"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

    "data": {
        "name": "ip_lookups",
        "vendor": "com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow",
        "enabled": true,
        "parameters": {
            "geo": {
                "database": "GeoIP2-City.mmdb",
                "uri": "gs://my-private-bucket/third-party/maxmind"
            },
            "isp": {
                "database": "GeoIP2-ISP.mmdb",
                "uri": "gs://my-private-bucket/third-party/maxmind"
            },
            "domain": {
                "database": "GeoIP2-Domain.mmdb",
                "uri": "gs://my-private-bucket/third-party/maxmind"
            },
            "connectionType": {
                "database": "GeoIP2-Connection-Type.mmdb",
                "uri": "gs://my-private-bucket/third-party/maxmind"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Additionally, if ASN data is available, this enrichment adds a new derived entity to the enriched event with [this schema](https://github.com/snowplow/iglu-central/blob/master/schemas/com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow/asn/jsonschema/1-0-0) (since enrich 6.7.0).

Here is an example of a derived entity attached by this enrichment:

```json
{
    "schema": "iglu:com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow/asn/jsonschema/1-0-0",
    "data": {
        "number": 64496,
        "organization": "Example organization"
    }
}
```
