# Getting Started with Support

## Overview

Our Support team is here 24x7 to provide you with product expertise and in-the-moment assistance throughout your journey with Snowplow, from event tracking design through to ongoing pipeline optimisation and beyond.

We are here for you in critical moments, or when you just have a question and can’t find the answer.

We’re here, too, to keep your pipeline running, your data quality high and your data set complete and current.

## Scope of Snowplow Support

The full scope of our support service, and more details of how we work with you can be found in our [Statement of Support](https://docs.snowplow.io/statement-of-support).

## Getting Help

### Submitting a support request

There are three primary ways to contact Snowplow Support:

- You can log a new request by directly navigating to our [Help Center](http://support.snowplow.io/):

![Help Center](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/VkG6SvIXgwJzJLLjeBYQ_qvT2bJjnKawcC0ps7AiBEf4h1H7QY2lpLi5tk5AgqWQxM6nSqNbJtFZWH-sxMfe1wm7i0rgz3gyHqrCDIlfuHOAvpQ5OIc2KzhJP6h6Qcc2fWulh945SmyZrMnRaQfeHw)

- Or you can log a new request through our Snowplow [BDP Console](https://console.snowplowanalytics.com/):

![BDP Console](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/woUpEx_CAz2EMf_UKKmRBVR4EIfEfdriADcXj1beotevq91P8AIj3aG7SD6vRNW2cZsqaDsip4aUsQNIwZ7CmmkOQq1BX2KvhyNuCYCqg3W31D_BOrIeV6KFFP2rIz1RjR8j2ACU1BzRUJo_dF8UyTY)

- Or you can log a new request by directly emailing [support@snowplow.io](mailto:support@snowplow.io).

You’ll receive an email when a support case has been updated, and also when the status changes. Whichever method you use to update that support case reply (by replying to that email, or updating tickets through the Help Center), all activity is recorded in the ticket and you can view/manage all your tickets in the Help Center.

### Help Center

When you submit a support request using any of the above methods, it will appear on the [Snowplow Help Center](http://support.snowplowanalytics.com/), where you can track the status of your requests and continue to work on them with us. You can also track all support requests that you are CC’ed on in the help center.

![Help Center](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/pwzYMyG5Rr0R-PjplJYSjHStglxnhAfVAdIFczseJSfGgJ7rVSXX2mj9DAHLOtvG0ZWzBmzTPNsHQ7-wBPeYPN-4v9MT5_jMEgPCUFMZqeb8tyrvhtrJDHkSnfadtQIXP_FZfY61ZMAmdro3VjZHjQ)

Click on ‘My Activities’ to access all your tickets and their current statuses. Your tickets will be in one of the following statuses:

- Open - our support team is actively working on this and will be in touch with an update. You can still update any ticket in Open status.
- Awaiting Your Reply - we have updated the ticket and are now waiting on a response from you to progress it further.
- Closed - the ticket has been closed and no further action is being taken on it.

‘Last Activity’ indicates the last time an internal update or reply was made by the Support team. Click through on any support request to see further details.

### Best practices

We will always do our very best to get you fast, accurate answers to your questions, and resolve any issues with your data or pipeline. That said, here are a few things you can do to help us get you the result you need as quickly as possible:

- Submit your requests through the Snowplow [BDP Console](https://console.snowplowanalytics.com/) (for BDP Cloud/Enterprise customers), the [Snowplow Help Center](http://support.snowplowanalytics.com/), or directly using the [support@snowplow.io](mailto:support@snowplow.io) email, rather than contacting other teams or folks within Snowplow using another method. We’re all here to help, but the fastest route to Support is the direct one.
- Provide as much detail as you can when you log a case. Let us know what you’ve tried, what the end goal is, and any other context you can. Let us know if anything has changed. Give us any errors that you see, or describe any unexpected behaviors. Provide any code that you think is relevant right when you log the call.
- Use a single support request for only one issue, question or challenge. If a conversation runs from one issue or question to another, it quickly gets difficult to track the real priority, problem and status. It really helps us to prioritise your requests, and get you the most accurate and appropriate response, if we can track and work on each of those issues or questions separately. That’s why we’ll always work with you to capture a new ticket for each issue.
