There are two options to attach geolocation information to Snowplow events:

1. Based on the user IP address in enrichments.
2. Using on device geolocation inside the Web or mobile app.

## Geolocation based on the IP address

Geolocation information can be automatically extracted from the IP address of the HTTP request to the collector.
This is done during enrichment using the [IP Lookup Enrichment](/docs/enriching-your-data/available-enrichments/ip-lookup-enrichment/index.md).

You can see the information added to events as [atomic event properties in this table](/docs/understanding-your-pipeline/canonical-event/index.md#location-fields).

## Geolocation context entity tracked in apps

Geolocation information can also be fetched in the app using our trackers and attached to events as a context entity.
This is often more accurate than the IP-based geolocation but requires permission from the user.

### How to track?

* [Using the JavaScript tracker](/docs/collecting-data/collecting-from-own-applications/javascript-trackers/web-tracker/tracker-setup/initialization-options/index.md#geolocation-context).
* Using the `TrackerConfiguration` object [on the Android tracker](https://snowplow.github.io/snowplow-android-tracker/snowplow-android-tracker/com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow.configuration/-tracker-configuration/geo-location-context.html) and [the iOS tracker](https://snowplow.github.io/snowplow-ios-tracker/documentation/snowplowtracker/trackerconfiguration/geolocationcontext(_:)).
