Event recovery allows to fix [failed events](/docs/fundamentals/failed-events/index.md) in some scenarios, so that you can ensure your data is complete and accurate.

A typical recovery process runs a script over a set of failed events to solve the issues (e.g. misspelt attribute name) and then attempts to re-process these events if necessary.

```mdx-code-block
