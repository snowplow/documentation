Now your pipeline is up and running, we can send a simple page\_view event to it to validate that it is working.

##### Using cURL

Send a simple request using cURL from your terminal. This example is a typical page\_view event, which has been taken from this website.

The example will also send a sample "failed event" (a custom `product_view` event that will fail due to an appropriate schema not being available to validate against) so that you can get a better understanding of how bad events are generated and what they look like.
