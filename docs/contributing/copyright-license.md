The loosely-coupled architecture of Snowplow makes it easy to swap out individual sub-system implementations for first- or third-party alternatives.

The Snowplow Analytics team curate some third-party sub-system implementations by git-submoduling those GitHub repositories into the Snowplow repositories.

Please note that third-party, git-submoduled contributions to Snowplow remain the copyright of their respective authors.

Third-party, git-submoduled contributions may be released under a different license to [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0); please consult the licensing information in their original GitHub repositories for confirmation.
