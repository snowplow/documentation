This section contains detailed technical information about Snowplow components.

Some of the information is relevant only for [Snowplow Self-Hosted](/docs/get-started/index.md#self-hosted) users, as [Snowplow CDI](/docs/get-started/index.md#customer-data-infrastructure) customers won't need to configure all their own components.
