The Snowplow Unity Tracker allows you to track Snowplow events from your Unity games and apps.

### Snowplow Icebreaker Demo

To see the Tracker in action you can download our demonstration game Snowplow Icebreaker from [Github](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-unity-tracker) and loading the SnowplowTracker.Demo folder into Unity 2020.3. You will need to set a valid collector endpoint on the Main Menu Page to see the events being generated.
