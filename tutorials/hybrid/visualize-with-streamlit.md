title: Visualize with Streamlit
position: 6
---

Streamlit uses Python to build shareable dashboards without the need for front-end development experience. The hybrid app dashboard provides insights into user behavior across both native app components and embedded web views.

## Clone the repository

Run the command below to download the example dashboard:

```bash
git clone --depth 1  --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/snowplow-incubator/snowplow-accelerator-resources.git ;
cd snowplow-accelerator-resources
git sparse-checkout set advanced-analytics-hybrid/streamlit
```

Next, move into the streamlit repository:

```bash
cd advanced-analytics-hybrid/streamlit
```

## Install requirements

Run the command below to install the project requirements and run the virtual environment.

**This implementation has been tested with the following dependencies: python = 3.9.13, streamlit = 1.18.1, pandas = 1.5.3, pandas-gbq = 0.19.1, plotly = 5.13.0, snowflake-connector-python = 3.0.0, pyarrow = 10.0.1. If you run into package compatibility issues or encounter any errors try using them to build your own environment.**

```bash
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

## Set up database connection

Create a secrets file at `.streamlit/secrets.toml` and add your BigQuery/Databricks/Snowflake connection details. For BigQuery: make sure you specify your custom `derived` dataset which will be the source schema for the dashboard.

:::note
Ensure `secrets.toml` is in `.gitignore` to keep your information safe.
:::

### BigQuery

For BigQuery, we recommend setting up your credentials in a similar way to your dbt `profiles.yml`, as seen [here](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/warehouse-setups/bigquery-setup#service-account-json):

```toml
# .streamlit/secrets.toml

[gcp_service_account]
type = "service_account"
project_id = "xxx"
private_key_id = "xxx"
private_key = "xxx"
client_email = "xxx"
client_id = "xxx"
auth_uri = "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth"
token_uri = "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token"
auth_provider_x509_cert_url = "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs"
client_x509_cert_url = "xxx"

[bigquery]
dataset = "dbt_xxx_derived"
```

### Snowflake

For Snowflake we recommend setting up your credentials in a similar way to your dbt `profile.yml`, as seen [here](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/warehouse-setups/snowflake-setup#user--password-authentication):

```toml
# .streamlit/secrets.toml

[snowflake]
user = "xxx"
password = "xxx"
account = "xxx"
database = "xxx"
schema = "xxx" # This should point to your derived schema
warehouse = "xxx"
role = "xxx"
```

:::note
In case the dashboard does not load due to errors such as 'This session does not have a current database. Call 'USE DATABASE', or use a qualified name.' a possible workaround is to assign default ROLE to the Snowflake user that could handle this.
:::

### Databricks

For Databricks, we recommend setting up your credentials in a similar way to your dbt `profiles.yml`, as seen [here](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/warehouse-setups/databricks-setup#set-up-a-databricks-target):

```toml
# .streamlit/secrets.toml

[databricks]
databricks_server_hostname = "xxx"
databricks_http_path = "xxx"
databricks_token = "xxx"
schema = "xxx" # This should point to your derived schema
catalog = "xxx"
```

## Specify warehouse

Edit the warehouse you are using on line 10 of the `Dashboard.py` file to one of `snowflake`, `bigquery` or `databricks`.

## Run the Streamlit dashboard

Run the command below to run the streamlit locally:

```bash
streamlit run Dashboard.py
```

![Mobile and Hybrid Apps Analytics Dashboard](images/visualisation/streamlit.png)

The dashboard provides comprehensive insights into your hybrid app performance, including:

- **Unified user journey visualization** - See how users move between native screens and web views
- **Session analysis** - Understand complete user sessions that span both contexts
- **Screen performance metrics** - Compare engagement across native and web view screens
- **Device and platform insights** - Analyze behavior patterns across different devices
- **Retention and engagement** - Track user retention patterns in the hybrid experience

This unified dashboard demonstrates the power of Snowplow's hybrid tracking approach, giving you complete visibility into user behavior across both native and web components of your application.
