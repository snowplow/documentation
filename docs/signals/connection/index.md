If you're new to Signals, you'll need to set up a Signals connection. Log in to [Snowplow Console](https://console.snowplowanalytics.com) and navigate to the **Signals** section.

<!-- TODO image initial landing page no deployment -->

Click **Enable** to start setting up a Signals connection. You'll need to provide your warehouse account details.

<!-- TODO image setup page -->

Click **Test and create connection** to trigger the Signals deployment. You'll be able to start using Signals as soon as the infrastructure is ready.

## Snowplow BDP Console

To use the UI to manage Signals, log in to [Console](https://console.snowplowanalytics.com) and navigate to the **Signals** section.

Use the configuration interface to define [attribute groups](/docs/signals/define-attributes/attribute-groups/index.md), [services](/docs/signals/define-attributes/services/index.md), and [interventions](/docs/signals/define-interventions/index.md).

<!-- TODO image initial landing page -->

## Signals Python SDK

Use the [Signals Python SDK](https://github.com/snowplow-incubator/snowplow-signals-sdk) to define attribute groups, services, and interventions via code.

To use the Python SDK, first choose where to store your Signals configurations. We recommend creating a new repository. The easiest way to use the SDK is within a Jupyter notebook.

Install the SDK into your environment:

```bash
pip install snowplow-signals
```

Once installed, you can start to define configuration components. To test or publish your configuration, or retrieve calculated attributes or interventions from the Profiles Store, you'll need to connect to your Signals deployment.

### Required credentials

To connect to Signals, you will need 4 values:

| Value           | Description                             | Where to get it                                                      | Format                                           |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Signals API URL | The API URL for your Signals deployment | BDP Console > **Signals** > **Overview**                             | `https://{{UUID}}.signals.snowplowanalytics.com` |
| API key         | A Snowplow API key                      | [Generated by you](/docs/account-management/index.md) in BDP Console | UUID                                             |
| API key ID      | A Snowplow API key ID                   | [Generated by you](/docs/account-management/index.md) in BDP Console | UUID                                             |
| Organization ID | Your Snowplow organization ID           | BDP Console > **Signals** > **Overview**                             | UUID                                             |

Add these four tokens to your environment or notebook secrets.

### Connecting to Signals

Create a `Signals` object by passing in the required values.

```python
from snowplow_signals import Signals

sp_signals = Signals(
    api_url=SIGNALS_DEPLOYED_URL,
    api_key=CONSOLE_API_KEY,
    api_key_id=CONSOLE_API_KEY_ID,
    org_id=ORG_ID,
)
```

## Signals API

The Signals API allows you to directly configure attributes and interventions. To access the full Swagger API documentation for your Signals deployment, use your Signals API URL followed by `/docs/`:

```bash
{{API_URL}}/docs/
```

Your Signals API URL will be available within Console once you've deployed Signals.

## Example use cases

Check out the Signals tutorials:
* [Quick Start](/tutorials/signals-quickstart/start) for defining stream attributes using the UI or the Python SDK
* [Real-time prospect scoring with ML](/tutorials/signals-ml-prospect-scoring/intro) solution accelerator uses the Python SDK
