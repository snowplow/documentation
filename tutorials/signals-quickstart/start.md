Welcome to the Snowplow Signals Quickstart! This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and use Snowplow Signals to define attributes, create views, and retrieve user features. By the end of this guide, you'll have a working setup to personalize your applications using Snowplow Signals.

1. **Install and Set Up the SDK**: Get started with the Snowplow Signals SDK.
2. **Define an Attribute**: Learn how to define stream user behavior attributes.
3. **Create and Test a View**: Combine attributes into a view and test it.
