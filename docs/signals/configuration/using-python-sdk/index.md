:::info
We strongly recommend using the BDP Console to configure and manage your Signals attributes and interventions. The UI includes error checking and versioning, for a safer and easier to use experience.
:::

There are two programmatical options for managing Signals:
* Signals API
* Signals Python SDK

Both of these methods require you to first deploy Signals using the self-serve process in Console, under the **Signals** section. After deployment, you'll have access to the Signals API URL needed for both API access and Python SDK usage.

## Using the Signals API

To access the full Swagger API documentation for your Signals deployment, use your Signals API URL followed by `/docs/`:

```bash
{{API_URL}}/docs/
```

## Using the Python SDK

The pages in this section describe how to use the [Signals Python SDK](https://github.com/snowplow-incubator/snowplow-signals-sdk) to define attribute groups, services, and interventions.

We recommend against choosing this route, especially for production use. The Console UI will help you safely configure your Signals deployment.

To use the Python SDK, first choose where to store your Signals configurations. We recommend creating a new repository. The easiest way to use the SDK is within a Jupyter notebook.

Within your notebook, install the SDK.

```bash
pip install snowplow-signals
```

Once installed, you can start to define your configuration components. To test or apply your configuration, or retrieve calculated attributes from the Profiles Store, you'll need to connect to your Signals deployment.

### Required credentials

To connect to Signals, you will need 4 values:

| Value           | Description                             | Where to get it                 | Format                            |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Signals API URL | The API URL for your Signals deployment | Provided by Snowplow            | `https://{{UUID}}.svc.snplow.net` |
| API key         | A Snowplow API key                      | Generated by you in BDP Console | UUID                              |
| API key ID      | A Snowplow API key ID                   | Generated by you in BDP Console | UUID                              |
| Organization ID | Your Snowplow organization ID           | Part of your BDP Console URL    | UUID                              |

You can find your Organization ID [on the **Manage organization** page](https://console.snowplowanalytics.com/settings) in Console. Follow the instructions in [Account management](/docs/account-management/index.md) to generate your API key and key ID.

Add these four tokens to your environment or notebook secrets.

### Connecting to Signals

Create a `Signals` object by passing in the required values.

```python
from snowplow_signals import Signals

sp_signals = Signals(
    api_url=SP_API_URL,
    api_key=SP_API_KEY,
    api_key_id=SP_API_KEY_ID,
    org_id=SP_ORG_ID,
)
```

The created `Signals` object has the following methods:

| Method                   | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apply`                  | Registers the provided objects with Signals                                 |
| `test`                   | Tests an attribute group against the atomic events table                    |
| `get_attribute_group`    | Retrieves an attribute group from the Profiles Store                        |
| `get_service_attributes` | Retrieves attributes for a specific service from the Profiles Store         |
| `get_attributes`         | Retrieves attributes for a specific attribute group from the Profiles Store |

Check out the [attribute groups](/docs/signals/configuration/using-python-sdk/attribute-groups/index.md), [services](/docs/signals/configuration/using-python-sdk/services/index.md), and [interventions](/docs/signals/configuration/using-python-sdk/index.md) pages to learn how to configure them programmatically.
