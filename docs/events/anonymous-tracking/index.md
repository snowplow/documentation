Snowplow enables you to track events without collecting personally identifiable information (PII). This is useful when you need to respect user privacy preferences, comply with regulations such as GDPR, or track events before a user has provided consent.

Every Snowplow event includes a number of [identifiers](/docs/events/identifiers/index.md). You can configure your trackers to prevent the collection of these identifiers, as well as IP addresses and cookies, using anonymous tracking. Snowplow trackers support multiple levels of anonymization, allowing you to balance privacy requirements with analytics needs:
* **Full client-side anonymization**: does not track any client-side user or session identifiers. Events can still be collected, but can't be grouped by user or session.
* **Client-side anonymization with session tracking**: doesn't track user identifiers but preserves session tracking. You can analyze session-level behavior without identifying individual users.
* **Server-side anonymization**: prevents the Collector setting the cookie for `network_userid` or capturing IP addresses.
* Full client-side and server-side anonymization: combines both approaches for maximum privacy.

As well as anonymous tracking, you can also use enrichments to pseudonymize or mask identifiers for tracked events, before they arrive at the data warehouse. This uses the [PII pseudonymization](/docs/pipeline/enrichments/available-enrichments/pii-pseudonymization-enrichment/index.md) or [IP anonymization](/docs/pipeline/enrichments/available-enrichments/ip-anonymization-enrichment/index.md) enrichments.

## Affected event properties

Use anonymous tracking to avoid collecting the following identifiers in your events. The table shows how you can anonymize each identifier using client-side anonymization, server-side anonymization, or enrichments.

## Toggling anonymous tracking

You can enable or disable anonymous tracking during a page visit or app session. This is useful for:

- Starting with anonymous tracking until a user accepts a cookie banner
- Enabling full tracking when a user logs in

On the web, use `enableAnonymousTracking()` and `disableAnonymousTracking()`. On mobile, set `userAnonymisation` in the tracker configuration.

When toggling anonymous tracking, be aware that:
- Enabling anonymous tracking clears user identifiers from outgoing events but does not delete existing cookies
- Use `clearUserData()` on the web to also delete stored identifiers
- On mobile, toggling anonymization starts a new session

## Web tracking and cookies

The JavaScript tracker uses cookies to persist user and session information. Understanding how cookies work helps you configure anonymous tracking correctly.

### First-party cookies

The tracker sets two first-party cookies by default:

| Cookie    | Purpose             | Contains                                             |
| --------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `_sp_id`  | User identification | `domain_userid`, session ID, visit count, timestamps |
| `_sp_ses` | Session management  | Used to detect session boundaries                    |

These cookies are controlled by the `stateStorageStrategy` configuration option. Setting it to `none` prevents all cookie and local storage use.

### Server-side cookie

The Collector sets a `sp` cookie containing the `network_userid`. This cookie is a first-party or third-party cookie depending on whether your Collector is on the same domain as your website.

When the `SP-Anonymous` header is present, the Collector does not set or read this cookie.

### Configuring cookieless tracking

For fully cookieless web tracking, configure the tracker with:

```javascript
anonymousTracking: { withServerAnonymisation: true },
stateStorageStrategy: 'none',
eventMethod: 'post'
```

This configuration:
- Prevents the tracker from storing data in cookies or local storage
- Adds the `SP-Anonymous` header to prevent server-side cookie and IP capture
- Uses POST requests (required for the anonymous header)

For more details on cookie behavior, see [Cookies and local storage](/docs/sources/web-trackers/cookies-and-local-storage/index.md).

## Pipeline enrichments for anonymization

In addition to anonymous tracking at the tracker level, you can pseudonymize or mask identifiers during enrichment.

### PII pseudonymization enrichment

The [PII pseudonymization enrichment](/docs/pipeline/enrichments/available-enrichments/pii-pseudonymization-enrichment/index.md) hashes specified fields using algorithms like SHA-256. This replaces identifiable values with consistent hashes, allowing you to join data without exposing the original values.

Fields that can be pseudonymized include:

- `user_id`
- `user_ipaddress`
- Fields within self-describing events and entities

The enrichment supports an `anonymousOnly` mode (available since Enrich version 5.3.0) that only pseudonymizes fields when the `SP-Anonymous` header is present. This lets you keep full identifiers for consented users while anonymizing non-consented users.

### IP anonymization enrichment

The [IP anonymization enrichment](/docs/pipeline/enrichments/available-enrichments/ip-anonymization-enrichment/index.md) masks portions of IP addresses by replacing octets (IPv4) or segments (IPv6) with "x" characters.

For example, `192.168.1.100` can become `192.168.x.x` or `192.x.x.x` depending on configuration.

This enrichment runs after the IP lookup enrichment, so geolocation data is derived from the full IP address before masking occurs.
