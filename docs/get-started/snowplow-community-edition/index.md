Snowplow Community Edition is an event data collection platform for data teams who want to manage the collection and warehousing of data across all their platforms and channels, in real-time.

Snowplow is a complete, loosely coupled platform that lets you capture, store and analyze granular customer-level and event-level data:

- Drill down to individual customers and events
- Zoom out to compare behaviors between cohorts and over time
- Join web analytics data with other data sets (e.g. CRM, media catalogue, product catalogue, offline data)
- Segment your audience by behavior
- Develop recommendations and personalisations engines

Snowplow has been technically designed to:

- Give you access, ownership and control of your own web analytics data (no lock in)
- Be loosely coupled and extensible, so that it is easy to add e.g. new trackers to capture data from new platforms (e.g. mobile, TV) and put the data to new uses
