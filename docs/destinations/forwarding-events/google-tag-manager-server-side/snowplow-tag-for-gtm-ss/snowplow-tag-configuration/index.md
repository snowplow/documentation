## Collector URL (Required)

Set this to the URL of your Snowplow Collector you wish to send events to.

## Cookies Settings

If you have configured your Snowplow collector to have different cookie details, you should ensure they match here.

### Name (Required)

This value must match the value of your Collector cookie name, this will allow the Snowplow Tag to find and return your Collector Cookie back to your users browser.

### Override Cookie Properties

If you'd like to overwrite your collectors cookie settings you can do that here.

#### Domain Override

To return a cookie with a different domain value than your collector, you can override it to another string here. "auto" will ensure the value is unchanged.

#### Path Override

This will override the path value of the cookie.

#### SameSite Override

This will override the SameSite flag on the cookie.

#### Expiration Override in Seconds

Allows the expiration time of the cookie to be altered. This value is in seconds, and defaults to 63072000 (2 years).

#### HttpOnly

Overwrites the HttpOnly flag on the cookie. Will be `true` if enabled (default), or `false` if disabled.

#### Secure

Overwrites the Secure flag on the cookie. Will be `true` if enabled (default), or `false` if disabled. Setting this to `false` and `SameSite` to `None` will prevent browsers from being able to store the cookie.

The logs generated by the Snowplow GTM SS Tag are standardized JSON strings.
The standard log properties are:

    "Type": "Message",  // the type of log (one of "Message", "Request", "Response")
    "TraceId": "xxx",   // the "trace-id" header if exists
    "EventName": "xxx"  // the name of the event the tag fired at
}
```

Depending on the type of log, additional properties are logged:

| Type of log | Additional information                                         |
