Snowplow Trackers are client- or server-side libraries which enable you to collect events from your own applications.

View our [webhooks for tracking events from third-party applications](/docs/collecting-data/collecting-data-from-third-parties/index.md).

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```
