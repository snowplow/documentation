The [LaunchDarkly Tag for GTM SS](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-gtm-server-side-launchdarkly-tag) allows events to be forwarded to LaunchDarkly using its [metric import REST API](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/creating-experiments/import-metric-events). This Tag works best with events from the Snowplow Client, but can also work with events from other GTM SS Clients such as GAv4.
