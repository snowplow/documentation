## Model Configuration

This packages make use of a series of other variables, which are all set to the recommend values for the operation of the models. Depending on your use case, you might want to override these values by adding to your `dbt_project.yml` file.

:::note

All variables in Snowplow packages start with `snowplow__` but we have removed these in the below table for brevity.

| `session_stitching`           | Determines whether to apply the user mapping to the sessions table. Please see the 'User Mapping' section for more details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | `True`                                 |
| `sessions_table`              | The users module requires data from the derived sessions table. If you choose to disable the standard sessions table in favor of your own custom table, set this to reference your new table e.g. `{{ ref('snowplow_web_sessions_custom') }}`. Please see the [README](https://github.com/snowplow/dbt-snowplow-web/tree/main/custom_example) in the `custom_example` directory for more information on this sort of implementation. | `{{ ref( 'snowplow_web_sessions' ) }}` |
| `start_date`                  | The date to start processing events from in the package, based on `collector_tstamp`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | '2020-01-01'                           |
| `ua_bot_filter`               | Configuration to filter out bots via the useragent string pattern match.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | `true`                                 |
| `upsert_lookback_days`        | Number of day to look back over the incremental derived tables during the upsert. Where performance is not a concern, should be set to as long a value as possible. Having too short a period can result in duplicates. Please see the incremental materialization section for more details.                                                                                                                                         | 30                                     |
