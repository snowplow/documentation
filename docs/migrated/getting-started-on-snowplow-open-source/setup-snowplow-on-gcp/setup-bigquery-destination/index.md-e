Snowplow supports streaming data into BigQuery in near real-time.

In order to do this, you need to setup the [BigQuery Loader](https://docs.snowplowanalytics.com/docs/pipeline-components-and-applications/loaders-storage-targets/bigquery-loader/). This loads enriched events from the enriched Pub/Sub topic, and streams them into BigQuery.
