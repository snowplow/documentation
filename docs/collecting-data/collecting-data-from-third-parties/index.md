Snowplow enables you to collect events via the webhooks of supported third-party software.

Webhooks allow this third-party software to send their own internal event streams to your Snowplow collector for further processing. Webhooks are sometimes referred to as "streaming APIs" or "HTTP response APIs".

View our [set of trackers for tracking events from your own applications](/docs/collecting-data/collecting-from-own-applications/index.md).
