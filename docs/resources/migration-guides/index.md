This section contains advice for migrating to Snowplow from other solutions.

There are two possible migration strategies: parallel-run or full re-architecture.

## Parallel-run

A parallel-run approach is the recommended, lowest-risk strategy. It involves running both systems simultaneously (dual-tracking) before switching over to Snowplow entirely. This allows you to test and validate your new Snowplow data in your warehouse, without affecting any existing workflows or production systems.

## Full re-architecture

A "rip-and-replace" approach is faster but riskier, involving a direct switch from your existing system to Snowplow. This is best suited for:

* Major application refactors where the switch can be part of a larger effort
* Teams with high risk tolerance and robust automated testing frameworks
* New projects or applications with minimal legacy systems

A full re-architecture strategy requires thorough testing in a staging environment to prevent data loss.
