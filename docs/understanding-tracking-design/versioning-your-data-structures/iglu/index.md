## How do I version?

### Breaking and non-breaking changes

When evolving your [schema](/docs/understanding-your-pipeline/schemas/index.md) and [uploading](/docs/understanding-tracking-design/managing-your-data-structures/iglu/index.md) it to your [Iglu Server](/docs/pipeline-components-and-applications/iglu/iglu-repositories/iglu-server/index.md), you will need to choose how to increment its version.

```mdx-code-block
import Breaking from "../_breaking.md"

<Breaking/>
```
