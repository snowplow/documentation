Snowplow offers a variety of native integrations which directly consume the real time stream (Kinesis/PubSub) of your Snowplow pipeline. These integrations are listed below.

## ElasticSearch (AWS only)

The Elasticsearch loader reads enriched data from the enriched Kinesis stream and streams it into Elasticsearch in near real-time.

* For Community Edition, see the Elasticsearch Loader [documentation](/docs/pipeline-components-and-applications/elasticsearch/index.md).
* For Snowplow BDP, you can [request setup](https://console.snowplowanalytics.com/destinations/catalog) through the Console.

## Azure Event Hubs

Event Hubs is a fully managed, real-time data ingestion service thatâ€™s simple, trusted and scalable. Snowplow can forward enriched data to Event Hubs from Kinesis or PubSub, depending on whether your pipeline is in AWS or GCP.

* For Community Edition, see [Snowbridge](/docs/destinations/forwarding-events/snowbridge/index.md).
* For Snowplow BDP, you can [request setup](https://console.snowplowanalytics.com/destinations/catalog) through the Console.

## Apache Kafka

Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform used by thousands of companies for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics, data integration, and mission-critical applications. Snowplow can forward enriched data to Kafka from Kinesis or PubSub, depending on whether your pipeline is in AWS or GCP.
