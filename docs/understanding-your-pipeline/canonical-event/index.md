## Overview

In order to analyze Snowplow data, it is important to understand how it is structured. We have tried to make the structure of Snowplow data as simple, logical, and easy-to-query as possible.

### Each line represents one event

Each line in the Snowplow events table represents a single _event_, be that a _page view_, _add to basket_, _play video_, _like_ etc.

### Structured data

Snowplow data is structured: individual fields are stored in their own columns, making writing sophisticated queries on the data easy, and making it straightforward for analysts to plugin any kind of analysis tool into their Snowplow data to compose and execute queries.

### Extensible schema

Snowplow started life as a web analytics data warehousing platform, and has a basic schema suitable for performing web analytics, with a wide range of web-specific dimensions (related to page URLs, browsers, operating systems, devices, IP addresses, cookie IDs) and web-specific events (page views, page pings, transactions). All of these fields can be found in the `atomic.events` table, which is a "fat" (many columns) table.

As Snowplow has evolved into a general purpose event analytics platform, we've enabled Snowplow users to define additional event types (we call these [_self describing events_](/docs/understanding-your-pipeline/events/index.md#self-describing-events)) and define their own entities (we call these [_custom entities_](/docs/understanding-your-pipeline/entities/index.md#custom-entities)) so that they can extend the schema to suit their own businesses.

For Snowplow users running Amazon Redshift, each type of self-describing event and each type of entity will be stored in their own dedicated tables. These additional tables can be joined back to the core `atomic.events` table, by joining on the `root_id` field in the self-describing event / entity table with the `event_id` in the `atomic.events` table, and the `root_tstamp` and `collector_tstamp` field in the respective tables. For users on other warehouses these will be additional columns in the `atomic.events` table.

### Single table

All the events are effectively stored in a single table, making running queries across the data very easy. Even if you're running Snowplow with Redshift and have extended the schema as described above, you can still query the data as if it were in a single fat table. This is because:
- The joins from the additional tables to the core `atomic.events` table are one-to-one.
- The field joined on is the distribution key for both tables, so queries are as fast as if the data were in a single table.

### Immutable log

The Snowplow data table is designed to be immutable: the data in each line should not change over time. Data points that we would expect to change over time (e.g. what cohort a particular user belongs to, how we classify a particular visitor) can be derived from Snowplow data. However, our recommendation is that these derived fields should be defined and calculated at analysis time, stored in a separate table and joined to the _Snowplow events table_ when performing any analysis.

## Out-of-the-box fields

The sections below go over the standard fields found in all Snowplow events grouped into categories. Some are platform independent (=comes out-of-the-box for both web and mobile trackers) and some will only get populated for a specific platform as indicated in the tables below ( ✅ | ❌ ).

As we are moving away from the wide table structure and shift the canonical fields into specific, tematically grouped entities (*contexts, self-describing events*) in places we will include a link to the specific tracking documentation so that you can find more information of the out-of-the-box options.

We also provide a `Source` for each field, however sometimes a field may have multiple sources e.g. a value originally set by a tracker but is overwritten by a later enrichment; in this case we have tended to classify this as the earliest source and adding more details where useful.

### Common fields (platform and event independent)
#### Application fields


| Field| Type | Description| Reqd? | Example | Source | Web | Mobile|
|----------|------|--------------------------------------|-------|---------------|----------|-----|---------|
| app_id | text | Application ID | Yes | 'angry-birds' | Tracking | ✅ | ✅ |
| platform | text | Platform, limited to specific values | Yes | 'web' | Tracking | ✅ | ✅ |

The application ID is used to distinguish different applications that are being tracked by the same Snowplow stack, e.g. `production` versus `dev`.

The platform ID is used to distinguish the same app running on different platforms, e.g. `iOS` vs `web`.

#### Date / time fields

| Field| Type| Description| Reqd? | Example | Source | Web | Mobile|
|------------------------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|---------------------------|--------------------------|-----|---------|
| collector_tstamp | timestamp | Timestamp for the event recorded by the collector| Yes | '2013-11-26 00:02:05' | Pipeline | ✅ | ✅ |
| dvce_created_tstamp| timestamp | Timestamp for the event recorded on the client device| No| '2013-11-26 00:03:57.885' | Tracking | ✅ | ✅ |
| dvce_sent_tstamp | timestamp | When the event was actually sent by the client device| No| '2013-11-26 00:03:58.032' | Tracking | ✅ | ✅ |
| etl_tstamp | timestamp | Timestamp for when the event was validated and enriched. Note: the name is historical and does not mean that the event is loaded at this point (this is further downstream). | No| '2017-01-26 00:01:25.292' | Pipeline | ✅ | ✅ |
| os_timezone | text| Client operating system timezone | No| 'Europe/London' | Tracking: [Timezone Plugin](/docs/collecting-data/collecting-from-own-applications/javascript-trackers/web-tracker/tracking-events/timezone-geolocation/index.md)| ✅ | ✅ |

#### Event / transaction fields

| Field | Type | Description | Reqd? | Example| Source| Web | Mobile|
|-------------------|------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----|---------|
| event | text | The type of event recorded| Yes | 'page_view'| Tracking| ✅ | ✅ |
| event_id| text | A UUID for each event | Yes | 'c6ef3124-b53a-4b13-a233-0088f79dcbcb' | Tracking (or enrichment if empty) | ✅ | ✅ |

A complete list of event types is given [here](#event-specific-fields).

#### Snowplow version fields

| Field| Type | Description | Reqd? | Example | Source | Web | Mobile|
|--------------|------|-------------------|-------|-------------------------------------|--------------------|-----|---------|
| v_tracker| text | Tracker version | Yes | 'js-3.0.0'| Tracking | ✅ | ✅ |
| v_collector| text | Collector version | Yes | 'ssc-2.1.0-kinesis' | Pipeline | ✅ | ✅ |
| v_etl| text | ETL version | Yes | 'snowplow-micro-1.1.0-common-1.4.2' | Default Enrichment | ✅ | ✅ |
| name_tracker | text | Tracker namespace | No| 'sp1' | Tracking | ✅ | ✅ |


Some Snowplow Trackers allow the user to name each specific Tracker instance. `name_tracker` corresponds to this name, and can be used to distinguish which tracker generated which events.

#### User-related fields

| Field | Type | Description | Reqd? | Example| Source | Web | Mobile|
|-------------------|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|----------------------------------------|----------------------|-----|---------|
| user_id | text | Unique ID set by business | No| 'c94f860b-1266-4dad-ae57-3a36a414a521' | Tracking | ✅ | ✅ |
| domain_userid | text | User ID set by Snowplow using 1st party client-set cookie, (only used for Web events!) | No| '4b0dfa75-9a8c-46a1-9691-01add9db4200' | Tracking | ✅ | ❌ |
| network_userid| text | User ID set by Snowplow using server-set cookie, which may be 1st or 3rd party, depending on collector configuration. | No| 'ecdff4d0-9175-40ac-a8bb-325c49733607' | Tracking or Pipeline | ✅ | ✅ |
| user_ipaddress| text | User IP address, can be overwritten with the IP Anonymization Enrichment| No| '92.231.54.234'| Tracking or Pipeline | ✅ | ✅ |
| domain_sessionidx | int| A visit / session index | No| 3| Tracking | ✅ | ❌ |
| domain_sessionid| text | A visit / session identifier| No| 'c6ef3124-b53a-4b13-a233-0088f79dcbcb' | Tracking | ✅ | ❌ |


`domain_sessionidx` is the number of the current user session. For example, an event occurring during a user's first session would have `domain_sessionidx` set to 1. The JavaScript Tracker calculates this field by storing a visit count in a first-party cookie. Whenever the Tracker fires an event, if more than 30 minutes have elapsed since the last event, the visitor count is increased by 1. (Whenever an event is fired, a "session cookie" is created and set to expire in 30 minutes. This is how the Tracker can tell whether the visit count should be incremented.) Thirty minutes is the default value and can be changed using the `sessionCookieTimeout` configuration option in the tracker.

It is worth to call out here that the `domain_userid` is regarded as the most reliable session based identifier for most use cases, it is therefore treated as the primary `user_identifier` field in our data models that rely on sessionisation (e.g. the Unified data model). These are only populated for web events, the mobile equivalent is embedded into an ootb entity called [Session Context Entity](/docs/collecting-data/collecting-from-own-applications/snowplow-tracker-protocol/ootb-data/user-and-session-identification/index.md#client-session-context-entity) which are then extracted (`session__user_id`) then coalesced with the web based domain_userid by default and being referred to as `user_identifier` within the data modeling package.

### Event-specific fields

Snowplow includes specific fields to capture data associated with specific events.

Note that to date, all event types have been defined by Snowplow. Also note that `event_vendor` values follow the [Java package naming convention](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/package/namingpkgs.html).

Snowplow currently supports the following event types:

| Event type| Value of `event` field in model|
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| [Page views](#page-views) | 'page_view'|
| [Page pings](#page-pings) | 'page_ping'|
| [E-commerce transactions](#e-commerce-transactions) | 'transaction' and 'transaction_item' |
| [Structured events](#structured-events) | 'struct' |
| [Self-describing events](#self-describing-events) | 'unstruct' (for legacy reasons) |

Details of which fields are available for which events are given below. In some cases these events will store values in the `atomic.events` columns, which are listed below.

#### Page views

There are currently no fields that are specific to `page_view` events: all the fields that are required are part of the standard fields available for any [web-based event](#web-specific-fields) e.g. `page_urlscheme`, `page_title`.

#### Page pings

There are four additional fields included with page pings that indicate how a user has scrolled over a web page since the last page ping:

| Field| Type| Description| Reqd? | Example |
| ---------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------- |
| `pp_xoffset_min` | integer | Minimum page x offset seen in the last ping period | No| 10 |
| `pp_xoffset_max` | integer | Maximum page x offset seen in the last ping period | No| 100 |
| `pp_yoffset_min` | integer | Minimum page y offset seen in the last ping period | No| 5 |
| `pp_yoffset_max` | integer | Maximum page y offset seen in the last ping period | No| 200 |

#### E-commerce transactions

There are a large number of fields specifically for transaction events.

Fields that start `tr_` relate to the transaction as a whole. Fields that start `ti_` refer to the specific item included in the transaction. (E.g. a product in the basket.) Single transactions typically span multiple lines of data: there will be a single line where `event` = `transaction`, where the `tr_` fields are set, and multiple lines (one for each product included) where `event` = `transaction_item` and the `ti_` fields are set.

| Field | Type| Description| Reqd? | Example |
| ------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | --------------- |
| `tr_orderid`| text| Order ID | Yes | '#134'|
| `tr_affiliation`| text| Transaction affiliation (e.g. store where sale took place) | No| 'web' |
| `tr_total`| decimal | Total transaction value| Yes | 12.99 |
| `tr_tax`| decimal | Total tax included in transaction value| No| 3.00|
| `tr_shipping` | decimal | Delivery cost charged| No| 0.00|
| `tr_total_base`*| decimal | Total in base currency | No| 12.99 |
| `tr_tax_base`*| decimal | Total tax in base currency | No| 3.00|
| `tr_shipping_base`* | decimal | Delivery cost in base currency | No| 0.00|
| `tr_city` | text| Delivery address, city | No| 'London'|
| `tr_state`| text| Delivery address, state| No| 'Washington'|
| `tr_country`| text| Delivery address, country| No| 'France'|
| `tr_currency` | text| Currency | No| 'USD' |
| `ti_orderid`| text| Order ID | Yes | '#134'|
| `ti_sku`| text| Product SKU| Yes | 'pbz00123'|
| `ti_name` | text| Product name | No| 'Cone pendulum' |
| `ti_category` | text| Product category | No| 'New Age' |
| `ti_price`| decimal | Product unit price | Yes | 9.99|
| `ti_price_base`*| decimal | Price in base currency | No| 9.99|
| `ti_quantity` | integer | Number of product in transaction | Yes | 2 |
| `ti_currency` | text| Currency | No| 'EUR' |

#### Structured events

[Structured events](/docs/understanding-your-pipeline/events/index.md#structured-events) allow you to send your own custom data, as long as it fits in the following 5 fields:

| Field | Type| Description| Reqd? | Example |
| ------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------- |
| `se_category` | text| Category of event| Yes*| 'ecomm', 'video'|
| `se_action` | text| Action performed / event name| Yes*| 'add-to-basket', 'play-video' |
| `se_label`| text| The object of the action e.g. the ID of the video played or SKU of the product added-to-basket | No| 'pbz00123'|
| `se_property` | text| A property associated with the object of the action| No| 'HD', 'large' |
| `se_value`| decimal | A value associated with the event / action e.g. the value of goods added-to-basket | No| 9.99|


\* These fields are only required for `struct` events.

#### Self-describing events

[Self-describing events](/docs/understanding-your-pipeline/events/index.md#self-describing-events) can contain their own set of fields, defined by their [schema](/docs/understanding-your-pipeline/schemas/index.md).

For each type of self-describing event, there will be a dedicated column (or table, in case of Redshift and Postgres) that holds the event-specific fields.

See [querying data](/docs/storing-querying/querying-data/index.md#self-describing-events) for more details on the structure and how to query it in different warehouses. You might also want to check [how schema definitions translate to the warehouse](/docs/storing-querying/schemas-in-warehouse/index.md).

For more information on this topic please check out the relevant [Tracking Documentation](/docs/collecting-data/collecting-from-own-applications/snowplow-tracker-protocol/custom-events/self-describing-events/index.md).

#### Entities

[Entities](/docs/understanding-your-pipeline/entities/index.md) (also known as contexts) provide extra information about the event, such as data describing a product or a user.

For each type of entity, there will be a dedicated column (or table, in case of Redshift and Postgres) that holds entity-specific fields. Note that an event can have any number of entities attached, including multiple entities of the same type. For this reason, the data inside the entity columns is an array.

See [querying data](/docs/storing-querying/querying-data/index.md#entities) for more details on the structure and how to query it in different warehouses. You might also want to check [how schema definitions translate to the warehouse](/docs/storing-querying/schemas-in-warehouse/index.md).

For more information on this topic please check out the relevant [Tracking Documentation](/docs/collecting-data/collecting-from-own-applications/snowplow-tracker-protocol/custom-events/context-entities/index.md).


### Out-of-the-box self-describing events and entities

These are also a variety of self-describing events and entities defined by Snowplow. You can find their schemas [here](http://iglucentral.com/?q=com.snowplowanalytics).
