If you are using a web browser to test your site or app, you can spoof a specific IP address using a browser plugin that sets an `X-Forwarded-For` header. For example, here are plugins for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/x-forwarded-for-header/hkghghbnihliadkabmlcmcgmffllglin/) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/x-forwarded-for-injector/). Install the plugin and set the IP address to your liking.
