**Give your AI agents and copilots the context they need to act intelligently with Snowplow Signals**.

Snowplow Signals equips your AI agents with real-time customer context. It computes user attributes from your Snowplow behavioral data and makes them available with sub-50 ms latency, so your agents can act on validated data instead of guesses.

Use Signals to:
* Stream enriched user context to chatbots, copilots, and other agentic applications
* Integrate with your existing AI tools such as LangChain, Amazon Bedrock, Vertex AI, or Vercel
* Deliver personalized recommendations, dynamic pricing, and adaptive UIs based on current behavior
* Trigger actions automatically when users meet specific criteria
