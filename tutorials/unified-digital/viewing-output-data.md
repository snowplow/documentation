```yaml
select * from dbt_ryan_derived.snowplow_unified_views;

```

The sessions table includes the engagement time in seconds, calculated using pings in comparison to absolute time. It also contains additional data, such as counts of page views and events.

The users table provides one row per user identifier, offering detailed information about each user.
