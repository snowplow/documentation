## Installation

Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/snowplow/) for the latest installation instructions, or read the [dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/package-management) for more information on installing packages. If you are using multiple packages you may need to up/downgrade a specific package to ensure compatibility.
