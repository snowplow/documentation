If you are running RDB Loader R35 or earlier, please upgrade to the [latest version of Snowplow RDB Loader](/docs/api-reference/loaders-storage-targets/snowplow-rdb-loader/index.md). There are [upgrade guides](/docs/api-reference/loaders-storage-targets/snowplow-rdb-loader/upgrade-guides/index.md) available for you to follow.

Before RDB Loader R32, it was necessary to [load events and entity types](/docs/api-reference/loaders-storage-targets/snowplow-rdb-loader/previous-versions/rdb-loader-r35-earlier/load-event-and-entity-types-that-you-have-defined/index.md) as part of loading into Redshift.
