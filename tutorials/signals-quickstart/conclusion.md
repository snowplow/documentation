In this tutorial you've learned how to use Signals to calculate and serve information about user behavior in real time.

This is the process workflow:

* Create attribute group
* Publish the attribute group to Signals
* Create service
* Retrieve calculated attribute values from the Profiles Store

## Next steps

Here are some ideas for further exploration:

* Try out other entities, e.g. `domain_userid`, to calculate the attributes against
* Define attributes based off other event types
* Retrieve calculated attributes in your real applications
