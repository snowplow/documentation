Welcome to the **example** tutorial.

Tutorials provide step-by-step instructions for implementing Snowplow features. The focus is on Snowplow functionality, rather than business use cases.

Include 1-3 paragraphs about the goal of the tutorial:
* Include links to the relevant docs pages
* Who is this for?
* What will they learn?
* Why would they want to do this?
* Where will they be carrying out the steps? E.g. Snowplow Console, a notebook, their own command line
* Roughly how long will it take to follow the tutorial?

State if a Snowplow account is required, or if they can use Sandbox, Micro, or Local.

Include a diagram or screenshot if it helps explain the purpose of the tutorial.

## Prerequisites

Add a bullet point list of requirements:
* Is it for customers only, or can they use Sandbox, Micro, or Local?
* Any specific technical knowledge required? Aim to make the tutorial as accessible as possible for new users.
* Any other third-party tools required?
* Is there a minimum release version required for any of the components?

Don't list API keys as a prerequisite: include how to get them as one of the tutorial steps.
