# Anonymous Tracking

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

:::info

This feature is available since v1.3.

:::

```mdx-code-block
import AnonymousTrackingSharedBlock from "@site/docs/reusable/anonymous-tracking-mobile/_index.md"

<AnonymousTrackingSharedBlock/>
```
There are several levels to the anonymisation depending on which of the three categories are affected:

## 1. Full client-side anonymisation

In this case, we want to anonymise both the client-side user identifiers as well as the client-side session identifiers. This means disabling the Session context altogether and enabling user anonymisation:

```typescript
const tracker = createTracker(
    'appTracker',
    {endpoint: COLLECTOR_URL},
    {
        trackerConfig: {
            sessionContext: false, // Session context entity won't be added to events
            userAnonymisation: true // User identifiers in Platform context (IDFA and IDFV) will be anonymised
        }
    }
);
```

## 2. Client-side anonymisation with session tracking

This setting disables client-side user identifiers but tracks session information. In practice, this means that events track the Session context entity but the `userId` property is a null UUID (`00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`). In case Platform context is enabled, the IDFA identifiers will not be present.

```typescript
const tracker = createTracker(
    'appTracker',
    {endpoint: COLLECTOR_URL},
    {
        trackerConfig: {
            sessionContext: true, // Session context is tracked with the session ID
            userAnonymisation: true // User identifiers in Session and Platform context are anonymised
        }
    }
);
```

## 3. Server-side anonymisation

Server-side anonymisation affects user identifiers set server-side. In particular, these are the `network_userid` property set in server-side cookie and the user IP address. You can anonymise the properties using the `serverAnonymisation` flag in `EmitterConfiguration`:

```typescript
const tracker = createTracker(
    'appTracker',
    {endpoint: COLLECTOR_URL},
    {
        emitterConfig: {
            serverAnonymisation: true
        }
    }
);
```

Setting the flag will add a `SP-Anonymous` HTTP header to requests sent to the Snowplow collector. The Snowplow pipeline will take care of anonymising the identifiers.
