## Hosting sp.js

Whilst weâ€™re offering CDN options, Snowplow does not recommend using third party providers in production for hosting JavaScript assets that you use on your websites. We encourage all users to host `sp.js` on their own servers, and this will always be the recommended best practice.

If you wish to follow our recommended best practices, please follow our [self hosting guide](/docs/collecting-data/collecting-from-own-applications/javascript-trackers/web-tracker/tracker-setup/hosting-the-javascript-tracker/index.md).
