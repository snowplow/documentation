## Snowplow offerings

You can choose between Snowplow BDP Enterprise (paid, hosted in your cloud), Snowplow BDP Cloud (paid, hosted by Snowplow) and Snowplow Open Source (free, hosted in your cloud). See the [feature comparison page](/docs/feature-comparison/index.md) for more information.

Each offering has its own setup guide:
* [Snowplow BDP Enterprise](/docs/getting-started-on-snowplow-bdp-enterprise/index.md)
* [Snowplow BDP Cloud](/docs/getting-started-on-snowplow-bdp-cloud/index.md)
* [Snowplow Open Source](/docs/getting-started-on-snowplow-open-source/index.md)

## Other options

### Try Snowplow

If you want to experiment with Snowplow but don’t feel like installing anything, check out [Try Snowplow](/docs/try-snowplow/index.md) — it’s a free 14-day self-serve trial experience (similar to BDP Cloud). Try Snowplow comes with a Postgres database included, so you can start tracking and analyzing events immediately.

### Snowplow Micro

While not a full substitute for a real Snowplow pipeline, [Snowplow Micro](/docs/testing-debugging/snowplow-micro/index.md) could be a quick way to get a feel for how Snowplow works for more technical users. Note that Micro does not store data in any warehouse or database, but you will be able to look at the available fields.
