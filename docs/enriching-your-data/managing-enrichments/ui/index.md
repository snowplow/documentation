Snowplow Console enables you to manage the Enrichments that run on each of your environments.

To start managing Enrichments, navigate to the environment you'd like to manage and select _Enrichments_ in the environment menu.

## View which Enrichments are running for an environment

When you select navigate to the Enrichments screen you'll see a listing of all Enrichments and see their current status & last edited date for the environment.

## Enable /editing an Enrichment

You can enable and edit enrichments on any environment, but we recommend the following workflow to test the configuration before deploying to a pipeline:

- Navigate to a sandbox environment (Snowplow Mini)
- Enable and configure the Enrichment as required
- Send some events to your Snowplow Mini endpoint and validate the fields appear as expected in the event payload
- Deploy the configuration to your pipeline(s)

### Enable the enrichment on a sandbox environment

**Navigate to a Snowplow Mini** and locate the enrichment you wish to enable. In the listing select _Configure and enable / Edit configuration_ from the pop up menu, or click the **Configure and enable / Edit config** button when viewing the enrichment.

**On the configuration screen**, edit the JSON configuration ([refer to each individual enrichments documentation for support](/docs/enriching-your-data/available-enrichments/index.md)) and click _Validate._

If your configuration is valid you will be given the option to _Publish_ the enrichment to the environment. If it is invalid you will be given validation errors to correct.

**_Publish_ your configuration** to the environment and then test it by sending some events to the Mini endpoint.

Once you are happy with your configuration, follow [Deploying a configuration across environments](#deploy) to deploy the configuration to a pipeline.

## Deploying an Enrichment configuration across environments

You will need to copy a configuration across environments when:

- you have followed our recommended _Edit / Enable_ workflow and wish to deploy your changes to a Pipeline
- you want to copy the configuration from one Snowplow Mini instance environment to another Snowplow Mini instance

**Navigate to the Snowplow Mini** that you want to deploy from, and locate the Enrichment you want to deploy to another environment.

**Click _Deploy_** in either the pop-up menu on the Listing screen, or the button in the View Enrichment screen.

In the modal that appears, select which environments you wish to copy to and click _Deploy configuration._

Important!

Deployments to pipeline environments currently involve work performed by our Support team. You can expect your change to be live within 24 hours.

## Disable an Enrichment

**Navigate to the environment** that contains the Enrichment you wish to disable.

In the listing select _Disable enrichment_ from the pop up menu, or click the **Disable** button when viewing the enrichment.

Confirm that you wish to disable the enrichment.
