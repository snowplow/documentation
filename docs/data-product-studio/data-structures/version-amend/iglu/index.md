## How do I version?

### Breaking and non-breaking changes

When evolving your [schema](/docs/fundamentals/schemas/index.md) and [uploading](/docs/data-product-studio/data-structures/manage/iglu/index.md) it to your [Iglu Server](/docs/api-reference/iglu/iglu-repositories/iglu-server/index.md), you will need to choose how to increment its version.

```mdx-code-block
import Breaking from "../_breaking.md"

<Breaking/>
```
