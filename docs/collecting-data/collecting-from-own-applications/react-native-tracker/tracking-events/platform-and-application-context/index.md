# Platform and application data tracking

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

Platform and application data tracking features capture information about the device and the app.

They are enabled by default. But the setting can be changed through `TrackerConfiguration` like in the example below:

```typescript
const tracker = createTracker(
    'appTracker',
    {
      endpoint: COLLECTOR_URL,
    },
    {
        trackerConfig: {
            applicationContext: true,
            platformContext: true,
        },
    }
);
```

## Application context

The [application context entity](https://github.com/snowplow/iglu-central/blob/master/schemas/com.snowplowanalytics.mobile/application/jsonschema/1-0-0) contains two properties:

| Property | Type | Description | Required in schema |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `version` | String | Version number of the application e.g 1.1.0 | Yes |
| `build` | String | Build name of the application e.g s9f2k2d or 1.1.0 beta | Yes |

## Platform context

The [platform context entity](https://github.com/snowplow/iglu-central/blob/master/schemas/com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow/mobile_context/jsonschema/1-0-3) contains the following properties:

| `physicalMemory` | Integer | Total physical system memory in bytes | No |
| `systemAvailableMemory` | Integer | Available memory on the system in bytes (Android only) | No |
| `appAvailableMemory` | Integer | Amount of memory in bytes available to the current app (iOS only) | No |
| `batteryLevel` | Integer | Remaining battery level as an integer percentage of total battery capacity | No |
| `batteryState` | String | Battery state for the device. One of: "unplugged", "charging", "full". | No |
| `lowPowerMode` | Boolean | A Boolean indicating whether Low Power Mode is enabled (iOS only) | No |
| `availableStorage` | Integer | Bytes of storage remaining | No |
| `totalStorage` | Integer | Total size of storage in bytes | No |
| `isPortrait` | Boolean | A Boolean indicating whether the device orientation is portrait (either upright or upside down) | No |
| `resolution` | String | Screen resolution in pixels. Arrives in the form of WIDTHxHEIGHT (e.g., 1200x900). Doesn't change when device orientation changes | No |
| `scale` | Number | Scale factor used to convert logical coordinates to device coordinates of the screen (uses UIScreen.scale on iOS and DisplayMetrics.density on Android) | No |
| `language` | String | System language currently used on the device (ISO 639) | No |
| `appSetId` | String | Android vendor ID scoped to the set of apps published under the same Google Play developer account (see https://developer.android.com/training/articles/app-set-id) | No |
| `appSetIdScope` | String (either "app" or "developer") | Scope of the `appSetId`. Can be scoped to the app or to a developer account on an app store (all apps from the same developer on the same device will have the same ID) | No |

### Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA/AAID)

The IDFA advertising identifiers are only added to the platform context if you fulfill the following requirements.
Otherwise, their values will be NULL.

<Tabs groupId="platform" queryString>
  <TabItem value="ios" label="iOS">

To track the IDFA identifier on iOS, you will need to initialize the tracker in native iOS (Swift or Objective-C) code. This is necessary because you will need to retrieve the ID from the `ASIdentifierManager` and pass it when creating the tracker in native code. Unfortunately, we can't provide this option in React Native since it would make the tracker library dependent on the API which would cause issues for apps that don't require it.

Please [follow the documentation for the iOS tracker](/docs/collecting-data/collecting-from-own-applications/mobile-trackers/installation-and-set-up/ios-tracker/index.md) to call the `Snowplow.createTracker()` function inside the `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method. Make sure to pass the `TrackerConfiguration.advertisingIdentifierRetriever` callback that retrieves the ID as [described here](/docs/collecting-data/collecting-from-own-applications/mobile-trackers/tracking-events/platform-and-application-context/index.md?platform=ios#identifier-for-advertisers-idfaaaid).

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="android" label="Android">

The AAID (Android Advertising ID) is a unique user-resettable identifier, which uniquely identifies a particular user for advertising use cases, such as ad personalization. The tracker allows retrieval of the AAID, sending it as property `androidIdfa`.

For privacy purposes the user can reset the identifier at any moment.
In that case the tracker will report a new AAID, despite the device and user being the same as before.
Also, the user can "Opt out of Ads Personalisation" from the Android settings menu.
In that case the tracker will report an empty string in place of the AAID.

If you want to track the AAID, you need to add the Google Mobile Ads library to your app.
If it isnâ€™t included, the tracker will not send the AAID with the events.

The Google Mobile Ads can be imported in the `dependencies` section of the `build.gradle` adding:

```gradle
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads:19.0.0'
    ...
}
```

The Google Mobile Ads SDK v.17.0.0 introduced some [changes](https://ads-developers.googleblog.com/2018/10/announcing-v1700-of-android-google.html) requiring a tag in the `androidManifest.xml` explained below.

#### Manifest tag for AdMob publishers

AdMob publishers have to add the AdMob app ID in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        <!-- TODO: Replace with your real AdMob app ID -->
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID"
            android:value="ca-app-pub-################~##########"/>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

Failure to add this tag will result in the app crashing at app launch with a message starting with "The Google Mobile Ads SDK was initialized incorrectly".

#### Manifest tag for Google Ad Manager publishers

Publishers using Google Ad Manager have to declare the app an "Ad Manager app" in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.AD_MANAGER_APP"
            android:value="true"/>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

Failure to add this tag will result in the app crashing at app launch with a message starting with "The Google Mobile Ads SDK was initialized incorrectly".
