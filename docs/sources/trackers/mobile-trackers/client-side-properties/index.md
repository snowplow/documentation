# Tracking specific client-side properties

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

An event describes a single, transient activity. The context in which that event occurs - the relatively persistent environment - is also incredibly valuable data.

The tracker allows the addition of a persistent set of information through the `SubjectConfiguration`, which represents the basic information about the user and the app. This data is added to every event as part of the [canonical event properties](/docs/sources/trackers/snowplow-tracker-protocol/going-deeper/event-parameters/index.md).

| Property | Description | Automatically added? | Column(s) in enriched event |
| -------- | ----------- |: --------------------- :| ----------------------------------- |
| `userId`           | User identifier.            | ❌                     | `user_id`                             |
| `ipAddress`        | User IP address.            | ✅                     | `user_ipaddress`                      |
| `timezone`         | Current timezone label.     | ✅                     | `os_timezone`                         |
| `language`         | Language set in the device. | ✅                     | `br_lang`                             |
| `useragent`        | User-agent.                 | ✅                     | `useragent`                           |
| `viewport`         | Screen viewport.            | ✅ (iOS) / ❌ (Android) | `br_viewheight`, `br_viewwidth`         |
| `screenResolution` | Screen resolution.          | ✅                     | `dvce_screenheight`, `dvce_screenwidth` |
| `colorDepth`       | Screen color depth.         | ❌                     | `br_colordepth`                       |
| `networkUserId`    | Network user ID.            | ✅                     | `network_userid`                      |
| `domainUserId`     | Domain user ID.             | ❌                     | `domain_userid`                       |

As always, be aware of privacy when tracking [personal identifiable information](https://snowplow.io/blog/2020/09/06/user-identification-and-privacy/) such as email addresses or IP addresses.
The tracker provides anonymous tracking functionality to mask certain user identifiers. Refer to the [section on anonymous tracking to learn more](../anonymous-tracking/index.md).

:::note Android screen resolution
The default screen resolution values are fetched from `WindowManager`, an older Android API. Screen resolution is also reported in the [platform context entity](/docs/sources/trackers/mobile-trackers/tracking-events/platform-and-application-context/index.md), which obtains the screen size from the Android context resources. The height value will likely be higher in `dvce_screenheight` than in the context entity, as the `WindowManager` size includes the menu bar.

To use the modern API throughout the tracker and standardize the screen resolution between event and entity properties, set `useContextResourcesScreenResolution(true)` flag in `SubjectConfiguration`. This flag is off by default, and available from Android tracker v6.0.3 onwards.

## Overriding autogenerated event properties

All enriched Snowplow events contain values for `user_ipaddress`, `useragent`, and `network_userid`.

Unless [anonymous tracking with server anonymisation](../anonymous-tracking/index.md) is enabled, the `user_ipaddress` is automatically added to all enriched events. To manually override this without using anonymous tracking, use a `SubjectConfiguration` and set an `ipAddress` string; use an empty string to prevent IP address tracking. Alternatively, use the [IP anonymization enrichment](/docs/pipeline/enrichments/available-enrichments/ip-anonymization-enrichment/index.md).

The `useragent` is also automatically added but it can be overriden on configuration. Snowplow pipelines provide multiple useragent-parsing [enrichments](/docs/pipeline/enrichments/available-enrichments/index.md). To manually override the detected useragent, set a `useragent` string.

The `network_userid` is the cookie value for the event collector's third-party cookie. The cookie is named `sp` (or `micro` for Snowplow Micro pipelines). To override the collector cookie’s value with your own generated ID, set `networkUserId`. Again, anonymous tracking with server anonymisation will prevent the addition of this property to events. The `network_userid` is stored in the tracker and is kept the same until the app is deleted or the collector endpoint is changed or the cookie is expired.

All other `Subject` properties can also be manually overriden via `SubjectConfiguration` and `SubjectController`.

## Set the `Subject` properties

Initialize the tracker with a `SubjectConfiguration` like this:

<Tabs groupId="platform" queryString>
  <TabItem value="ios" label="iOS" default>

```swift
let subjectConfig = SubjectConfiguration()
    .userId("username")

let networkConfig = NetworkConfiguration(endpoint: "https://snowplow-collector-url.com")
Snowplow.createTracker(
    namespace: "appTracker",
    network: networkConfig,
    configurations: [subjectConfig]
)
```

See the API docs for the full [list of options](https://snowplow.github.io/snowplow-ios-tracker/documentation/snowplowtracker/subjectconfiguration).

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="android" label="Android (Kotlin)">

```kotlin
val subjectConfig = SubjectConfiguration()
    .userId("username")

val networkConfig = NetworkConfiguration("[http:/endpoint](https://snowplow-collector-url.com)")
Snowplow.createTracker(
    applicationContext,
    "namespace",
    networkConfig,
    subjectConfig
)
```

See the API docs for the full [list of options](https://snowplow.github.io/snowplow-android-tracker/snowplow-android-tracker/com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow.configuration/-subject-configuration/index.html).

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="android-java" label="Android (Java)">

```java
SubjectConfiguration subjectConfig = new SubjectConfiguration()
    .userId("username");

NetworkConfiguration networkConfig = new NetworkConfiguration(
    "https://snowplow-collector-url.com"
);
Snowplow.createTracker(
    getApplicationContext(),
    "appTracker",
    networkConfig,
    subjectConfig
);
```

See the API docs for the full [list of options](https://snowplow.github.io/snowplow-android-tracker/snowplow-android-tracker/com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow.configuration/-subject-configuration/index.html).

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Subject properties can be updated or added to after initialization using the `SubjectController` retrieved from the tracker:

<Tabs groupId="platform" queryString>
  <TabItem value="ios" label="iOS" default>

```swift
let tracker = Snowplow.defaultTracker()
tracker?.subject?.userId = ""
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="android" label="Android (Kotlin)">

```kotlin
val tracker = Snowplow.defaultTracker
tracker?.subject?.userId = ''
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="android-java" label="Android (Java)">

```java
TrackerController tracker = Snowplow.getDefaultTracker();
tracker.getSubject().setUserId("");
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
