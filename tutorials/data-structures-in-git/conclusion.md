* We have seen how snowplow-cli can be used to work with data structures from the command line
* We have applied that knowledge to build github workflows which support automated validation and publication
* We have added source applications, tracking plans and event specifications to use the same approach as data structures.

This approach provides you with:
- **Version control** for your data structures with full change history
- **Automated validation** to catch errors before they reach production
- **Approval workflows** through pull requests
- **Environment promotion** from development to production
- **Integration with tracking plans** for comprehensive data governance

You now have a complete CI/CD pipeline for managing your Snowplow data structures using industry-standard tools and practices.
