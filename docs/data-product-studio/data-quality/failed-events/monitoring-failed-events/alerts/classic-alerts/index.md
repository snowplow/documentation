Snowplow can send two types of pipeline alerts to help you monitor failed events:

- **New failed event:** receive an alert within 10 minutes of a new type of event failure being detected on your pipeline.
- **Failed event digest**: receive a daily digest of all failed event activity in the previous 48-hour period.


To receive alerts you must have the failed events [monitoring](/docs/data-product-studio/data-quality/failed-events/monitoring-failed-events/index.md) feature switched on in Snowplow BDP Console.

## Subscribing to alerts

- Login to Snowplow BDP console
- Locate the pipeline you wish to set up alerts for in the left-hand navigation
- Click on the `Configuration` tab, then the `Pipeline alerts` section
