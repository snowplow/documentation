[Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/) is a fully-managed cloud data warehouse with rich support of semi-structured data and tight integration with GCP. Snowplow allows to load data into Snowflake with [Snowplow RDB Loader](/docs/destinations/warehouses-and-lakes/rdb/index.md). Loading enriched Snowplow data requires a transformation step and a loading step, so you'll need to select and set up both a transformer and a Snowflake loader. You can find out how to do this in the Snowplow RDB loader [docs](/docs/destinations/warehouses-and-lakes/rdb/index.md).
