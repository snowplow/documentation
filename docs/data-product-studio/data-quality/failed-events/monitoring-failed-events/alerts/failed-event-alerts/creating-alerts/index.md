Set up failed event alerts to receive notifications when failed events occur in your data pipeline.


You'll need access to the [data quality dashboard](/docs/data-product-studio/data-quality/failed-events/monitoring-failed-events/index.md#data-quality-dashboard).

To create an alert, go to the BDP Console:
1. Navigate to **Data Quality** in the left sidebar
2. Click **Manage alerts** in the top-right corner
3. Click **Create alert**

2. Add recipient email addresses
3. Click **Add filters** to configure filters
4. Configure triggers as needed
5. Enter alert name (e.g., "mobile-app")

### Slack notifications

When no active Slack integration is found, a `Connect with Slack` button will appear instead of the list of channels.

A Slack consent screen will appear.

To select channels in the UI, first add the app to those channels. In Slack:

1. Open the channel where you want notifications
2. Type `@Snowplow Notifications` and send
3. Click "Add them" when prompted

Once a Slack alert is configured you will see a confirmation notification in the selected Slack channel.

## Set up filters

Configure when alerts should trigger:

1. **Issue types**: select `ValidationError`, `ResolutionError`, or both
2. **Data structures**: choose specific data structures (all versions will apply)
3. **App IDs**: filter by application identifiers

## Configure triggers

Set up when alerts should be triggered based on failed event conditions:

### Trigger types

Choose from the available trigger options:

- **When above value**: Set an absolute threshold for failed events (e.g., 1,500 failed events per hour)
- **On any issue**: Alert when any failed events are detected

### Threshold configuration

When using "When above value" trigger:

1. **Value**: Enter the threshold number of failed events
2. **Time period**: Select the time window (10 minutes, hour, or day)
3. **Deliver**: Choose notification frequency (daily, weekly, or monthly)

#### Insights from historical data

When configuring a threshold alert, an insights panel appears showing data from the past 7 days to help you set appropriate thresholds:

- **Average events for the selected time period**: Shows the average number of valid and failed events
- **Suggested threshold value**: Provides a recommended threshold
- **Apply suggestion**: Click to automatically populate the threshold value field with the suggested value

This helps you set realistic thresholds based on your actual event patterns.

An alert will be sent once per the selected delivery frequency if the trigger condition is met.

## Complete setup

1. Review your configuration
2. Click **Confirm** to create the alert
3. Your alert will appear in the alerts list

## Alert frequency

Alerts are checked every 10 minutes. You'll receive notifications when new failed events match your filter criteria.
