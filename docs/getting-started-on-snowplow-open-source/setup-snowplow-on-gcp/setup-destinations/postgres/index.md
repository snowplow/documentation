Snowplow supports loading data into Postgres.

If you would like to query your enriched Snowplow data in Postgres, you can set up the [Postgres Loader](/docs/destinations/warehouses-and-lakes/postgres/index.md), which can read the data from your enriched Pub/Sub topic and write it to your Postgres instance.
