The [Snowplow Tag for GTM SS](https://tagmanager.google.com/gallery/#/owners/snowplow/templates/snowplow-gtm-server-side-tag) is most useful if using GTM SS as a Server Side Tag Manager for Snowplow JavaScript Tracker events, as you will want to ensure you forward these events to your Snowplow Collector. The Snowplow Tag will automatically forward any events the Snowplow Client receives once it has been configured with your Collector URL.

The Snowplow Tag can also construct Snowplow events from other GTM SS Clients such as GAv4.

## Snowplow Tag Setup

With the template installed, you can now add the Snowplow Tag to your GTM SS Container.
