This section contains detailed technical information about Snowplow components.

Some of the information is relevant only for [Community Edition](/docs/get-started/snowplow-community-edition/index.md) users, as [Snowplow BDP](/docs/get-started/snowplow-bdp/index.md) customers won't need to configure all their own components.
