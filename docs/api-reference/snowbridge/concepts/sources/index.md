# Sources

Sources deal with retrieving data from the input stream, and forwarding it for processing — once messages are either filtered or successfully sent, they are then acked (if the source technology supports acking). Otherwise, messages will be retrieved again by the source. Sources also have a setting which controls concurrency for the instance — `concurrent_writes`.

You can find more detail on setting up a source, in the [configuration section](/docs/api-reference/snowbridge/configuration/sources/index.md).
