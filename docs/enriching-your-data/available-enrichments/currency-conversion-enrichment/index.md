This enrichment uses [Open Exchange Rates](https://openexchangerates.org/) to convert the currencies used in transactions. It requires an Open Exchange Rates.

When transactional data is collected in multiple currencies, it can be useful to convert it in the one that is used for reporting for instance. This could help to lower discrepancies when reporting revenue amounts across multiple currencies.

The conversion is done by the enrich job at processing time with Open Exchange Rates API so that it can be stored directly with the right currency in the database.
