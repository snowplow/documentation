Testing that your event tracking is properly configured can be as important as testing the other aspects of your app. It confirms that you are generating the events you expect.

We recommend using [Snowplow Micro](/docs/data-product-studio/data-quality/snowplow-micro/what-is-micro/index.md) for testing and debugging â€” you can even use it for [automated tests](/docs/data-product-studio/data-quality/snowplow-micro/automated-testing/index.md).
