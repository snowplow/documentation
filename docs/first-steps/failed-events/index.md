If you have defined some custom events in the previous section, we recommend playing around with sending invalid data to see what happens.

For example, if your custom event has a numeric field, try sending a string. It will not reach your warehouse! Instead, a [failed event](/docs/understanding-your-pipeline/failed-events/index.md) will be generated.

If you have not defined any custom events yet, you can use the following command-line snippet to send yourself an invalid event (it uses a nonexistent schema `com.my_company/product_view/jsonschema/1-0-0`):

```bash
curl 'https://{{COLLECTOR_URL}}/com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow/tp2' \
   -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8' \
   -H 'Cookie: _sp=305902ac-8d59-479c-ad4c-82d4a2e6bb9c' \
