We are the leader in customer data infrastructure (CDI) for AI, enabling every organization to transform raw behavioral data into governed, high-fidelity fuel for AI-powered applications—including advanced analytics, real-time personalization engines, and AI agents.

Digital-first companies like Strava, HelloFresh, Auto Trader, Burberry, and DPG Media rely on Snowplow to collect and process event-level data in real time, delivering it securely to their warehouse, lake, or stream, and to integrate deep customer context into their applications.
