## Overview

The Snowplow Analytics SDKs are designed for data engineers and data scientists working with Snowplow in a number of languages.

Some good use cases for the SDKs include:

1. Transforming the Enriched TSV to Enriched JSON for further processing
2. Developing AI/ML models on your event data
3. Performing analytics-on-write in AWS Lambda as part of our Kinesis real-time pipeline
4. Within Snowplow pipeline components to process event data
