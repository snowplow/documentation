The Iterable Tag for GTM SS allows events to be forwarded to Iterable. This Tag works best with events from the Snowplow Client, but can also construct Iterable events from other GTM SS Clients such as GAv4.

The tag is designed to work best with Self Describing Events, and atomic events, from a Snowplow Tracker, allowing for events to automatically be converted into an Iterable events, include Iterable Identity events.
