Attribute groups are where you define the data you want to calculate. Each attribute group is a versioned collection that specifies:
* The **attributes** to calculate - the specific behavioral facts about users
* The **data source** - whether to calculate from the real-time stream, or in batch from the warehouse
* The **attribute key** that provides the analytical context
* Other metadata such as description or owner

## Types of attribute

Attributes describe what kind of calculation to perform, and what event data to evaluate. They can only exist within attribute groups.

Attributes can be categorized into four main types, depending on the type of user behavior you want to understand:

| Type          | Description                                            | Example                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Time windowed | Actions that happened within the last X period of time | `products_added_to_cart_last_10_min` |
| Lifetime      | Calculated over all the available data                 | `total_product_price_clv`            |
| First touch   | The first event or property that happened              | `first_mkt_source`                   |
| Last touch    | The most recent event or property that happened        | `last_device_class`                  |

Signals includes a range of different aggregations for calculating attributes, including `mean`, `counter`, or `unique_list`. See the full list in the [attribute configuration](/docs/signals/define-attributes/attributes/index.md) page.

## Attribute keys

An attribute key is an identifier that provides the analytical context for all attribute calculations within a group. The identifier can be any atomic field of a Snowplow event, such as `domain_userid`.

To demonstrate the necessity of attribute keys, consider the attribute `num_views_in_last_10_min`. It represents a count of page view events, with a 10 minute time limit. This table lists some possible meanings of the attribute, based on the attribute key configured for its attribute group:

| Attribute                  | Attribute key      | Description                                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `num_views_in_last_10_min` | User               | How many pages a user has viewed within the last 10 minutes                         |
| `num_views_in_last_10_min` | Page               | How many page views a page has received within the last 10 minutes                  |
| `num_views_in_last_10_min` | Product            | How many times a product has been viewed within the last 10 minutes                 |
| `num_views_in_last_10_min` | App                | How many page views occurred within an app in the last 10 minutes                   |
| `num_views_in_last_10_min` | Device             | How many page views came from a specific device in the last 10 minutes              |
| `num_views_in_last_10_min` | Marketing campaign | How many page views were generated by a campaign in the last 10 minutes             |
| `num_views_in_last_10_min` | Geographic region  | How many page views came from users in one region within the last 10 minutes        |
| `num_views_in_last_10_min` | Customer segment   | How many page views were generated by users in a segment within the last 10 minutes |

Each of these is likely to have a different calculated value.

You can [define your own attribute keys](/docs/signals/define-attributes/attribute-groups/index.md#attribute-keys), or use the built-in ones. Signals comes with predefined attribute keys for user, device, and session. Their identifiers are from the out-of-the-box atomic [user-related fields](/docs/fundamentals/canonical-event/index.md#user-fields) in all Snowplow events.

| Attribute key      | Type     |
| ------------------ | -------- |
| `user_id`          | `string` |
| `domain_userid`    | `uuid`   |
| `network_userid`   | `uuid`   |
| `domain_sessionid` | `uuid`   |

## Services

Services are where you define how to use the calculated attributes in your applications.

Rather than connecting applications directly to attribute groups, services allow you to consume specific attribute group versions. This provides a consistent set of consumable attributes. We strongly recommend using services in production applications.

By using services you can:
* Iterate on attribute definitions without worrying about breaking downstream processes
* Migrate to new attribute group versions by updating the service definition, without having to update the application code

## Profiles Store

The Profiles Store is a database where Signals saves all your calculated attribute values. When Signals calculates attributes from your events or warehouse data, or syncs pre-calculated data, it stores them here organized by attribute group. Your applications retrieve these stored values using the Signals SDKs or API.

The Profiles Store keeps track of current attribute values, and automatically removes old data based on the TTL settings you configure for each attribute group. It acts as the central source of truth for your Signals deployment.
