While Snowplow provides various [events](/docs/fundamentals/events/index.md) and [entities](/docs/fundamentals/entities/index.md) out of the box, you can define your own to match your business more closely.

The documentation on [self-describing events](/docs/fundamentals/events/index.md#self-describing-events) provides a high-level view of how you might create and track one. For more guidance, check out [this tutorial](/docs/recipes/recipe-basic-tracking-design/index.md).
