As described in [Data Products introduction](/docs/understanding-your-pipeline/data-products/), a data product is a logical grouping of the data you collect as an organisation by domain, with an explicit owner. 

With data products, you can:

* Set clear ownership for the data being created
* Make tracking implementation easier
* Deliver better governance around your data
* More easily communicate what the data means and how to use it
* Collaborate more effectively with the various teams involved in delivering value from your data
