Media tracking has [multiple versions](/docs/sources/trackers/javascript-trackers/web-tracker/tracking-events/media/index.md) of schema available.
This document is for version 2 of the schemas; tracker versions earlier than v0.3.0 [only support v1 tracking](/docs/sources/trackers/roku-tracker/media-tracking/v1/index.md).


## Configuration

Most tracking of [Audio](https://developer.roku.com/en-au/docs/references/scenegraph/media-playback-nodes/audio.md) and [Video](https://developer.roku.com/en-au/docs/references/scenegraph/media-playback-nodes/video.md) nodes is automatic, so configuration is minimal.

The primary method for configuring media tracking is the `enableMediaTracking` method, which should include the options below, including the media node to track.
It has a corresponding `disableMediaTracking` method to stop generating events.
For events not automatically tracked, `trackMediaEvent` allows tracking custom events while including media-related entities.

The accepted options include:

| Attribute | Type | Description | Required? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `media` / `audio` / `video` | Audio / Video | Audio/Video node to be tracked | yes |
| `version` | Integer | Tracking schema version to use; defaults to `2` when using `enableMediaTracking` | no |
| `id` | UUID | A unique ID to use for the media `session` entity to group all tracked events | no; generated by tracker if not provided |
| `label` / `options.label` | String | An identifiable custom label sent with the event in the `media_player` entity | no |
| `sessions` | boolean | Whether to attach the media `session` entity on tracked events | no; defaults to `true` |
| `pings` | boolean | Whether to periodically generate media `ping_event`s while content is playing | no; defaults to `true` |
| `pingInterval` / `options.positionInterval` | Integer | Interval in seconds in which `ping_event`s should be reported | no, defaults to `30` seconds |
| `boundaries` / `options.boundaries` | Integer[] | Percentage boundaries in playback for which `percentage_progress_event`s will be sent | no, defaults toÂ `[25, 50, 75]` |
| `captureEvents` / `options.captureEvents` | String[] | Types of events to capture. If specified, the event names should not have the `_event` suffix | no, defaults to all events |
| `context` / `entities` | SelfDescribingJSON[] | Array of custom entities to include with all generated events | no |

## Migrating from v1

If you are migrating from the [v1 media tracking](/docs/sources/trackers/roku-tracker/media-tracking/v1/index.md), v2 has compatibility options to make the change easier.

For backwards compatibility with the earlier tracking API, you can continue using `enableVideoTracking` or `enableAudioTracking` instead of `enableMediaTracking`, and pass the node via the `audio`/`video` option instead of `media`.
For most other options, v2 will accept either v1 or v2 `roAssociativeArray` formats.
The tracking will work with any combination of these method and option names regardless of node type, as long as `version: 2` is specified.
You can also specifically opt into version 1 by passing `version: 1` for any of these methods, though v2 options may not be recognized.

If using specific `version` values, the same version should also be specified for the corresponding `disable*Tracking` method.
Similarly, mixing `enableVideoTracking` and `disableMediaTracking` will not work unless versions are specified consistently.

The additional options differ by version; but version 2 will accept the options from version 1 if it can't find the newer equivalent settings.

| v2 Attribute | v1 Fallback | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `media` / `audio` / `video` | `media` / `audio` / `video` | Audio / Video | Audio/Video node to be tracked |
| `version` | `version` | Integer | Tracking schema version to use; should be set to 2 if not using `enableMediaTracking` |
| `id` | N/A | UUID | A unique ID to use for the media `session` entity to group all tracked events |
| `label` | `options.label` | String | An identifiable custom label sent with the event in the `media_player` entity |
| `sessions` | Default enabled | boolean | Whether to attach the media `session` entity on tracked events |
| `pings` | Default enabled | boolean | Whether to periodically generate media `ping_event`s while content is playing |
| `pingInterval` | `options.positionInterval` | Integer | Interval in seconds in which `ping_event`s should be reported |
| `boundaries` | `options.boundaries` | Integer[] | Percentage boundaries in playback for which `percentage_progress_event`s will be sent |
| `captureEvents` | `options.captureEvents` | String[] | Types of events to capture. If specified, the event names should not have the `_event` suffix |
| `context` / `entities` | `context` | SelfDescribingJSON[] | Array of custom entities to include with all generated events |
