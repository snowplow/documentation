The following pages contain specific examples for building custom models to do specific things. They are meant to help you understand how to go about building certain types of custom models and are by no means an exhaustive list of what you can do, and you can mix and match elements to fit your needs.

If you would like to see how an actual implementation could work in practice, check out our [example dbt project](https://github.com/snowplow-incubator/dbt-example-project/tree/main/custom_event_table_unified) in the form of a github repository. You will see how in this case the Unified Digital package can be used as a base to add some customizations to, in order to alter the package behavior without having to fully fork the package for custom use cases (e.g. macro overwrite, adding a custom data model, overwriting variables etc.).

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
