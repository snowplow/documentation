Once you've defined your [tracking plans](/docs/event-studio/tracking-plans/index.md) and [event specifications](/docs/event-studio/tracking-plans/event-specifications/index.md), the next step is implementing the tracking code in your applications.

Snowplow provides several approaches to generate and implement tracking code:
* Ready-to-use code snippets in [Console](https://console.snowplowanalytics.com) (web only)
* [Snowtype](/docs/event-studio/implement-tracking/snowtype/index.md) code generation tool
* Manual integration with [Snowplow trackers](/docs/sources/index.md)

## Console code snippets

When viewing an [event specification](/docs/event-studio/tracking-plans/event-specifications/index.md) in Console, the **Working with this event** section provides ready-to-use code snippets.

The snippets in the **Implementation** tab show the exact tracking calls needed for each event, including all required properties and entities.

:::note Available for custom web events only
Code snippets are available for the JavaScript tracker only, for event specifications with custom event data structures.
:::

Here's an example snippet for the JavaScript tracker. It provides a `trackSelfDescribingEvent` call for the event specification, with the correct schema references and properties.

The example event specification has an event data structure named `article_click`, and one entity data structure, `article`. The snippet also includes an autogenerated `event_specification` entity. This helps with analysis as it's a direct link between the tracked event and the tracking plan.

To use your snippet, paste it into your application code, and provide the appropriate property values.

```javascript
window.snowplow("trackSelfDescribingEvent", {
    "event": {
        "schema": "iglu:com.example/article_click/jsonschema/1-0-1",
        "data": {
            "name": "", // string - Required - maxLength: 1000
            "location": "", // string - Nullable - maxLength: 1000
        }
    },
    "context": [
        // Entity: article (min: 0)
        {
            "schema": "iglu:com.example/article/jsonschema/3-0-0",
            "data": {
                "publish_date": "", // string - Nullable
                "content_id": "", // string - Nullable
            }
        },
        // System entity. Please do not edit it.
        {
            "schema": "iglu:com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow/event_specification/jsonschema/1-0-3",
            "data": {
                "id": "0a0ef8bb-314c-4973-8988-f192e8714d68",
                "name": "Article Click",
                "data_product_id": "28a6316a-47fd-473b-b5a1-00c555ba25e4",
                "data_product_name": "Article Performance",
                "data_product_domain": "Marketing"
            }
        }
    ]
});
```

Use the **Show Snowtype code** toggle to display the specific Snowtype function name to call for tracking implementation.
