Once you know how you want to configure the recovery job, it's worthwhile to test your configuration locally, before deploying an actual recovery job.

For that purpose we provide a `snowplow-event-recovery` command line interface. Latest versions are available through [GitHub release page](https://github.com/snowplow-incubator/snowplow-event-recovery/releases/latest).

The CLI provides commands for validating (`snowplow-event-recovery validate`) and running test recoveries (`snowplow-event-recovery run`).  See `snowplow-event-recovery --help` for the most up-to-date options descriptions.

### Validate

Validation checks configuration schema to verify that actual job can be ran. To validate the configuration, run:

```
snowplow-event-recovery validate --config /opt/scenarios.json
```

Which will result in:
```
OK! Config valid
```

Or an detailed error message:

```
ERROR! Invalid config

Instance is not valid against its schema:
* At $.iglu:com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow.badrows/adapter_failures/jsonschema/1-0-*[0].conditions[0].op:
  - $.iglu:com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow.badrows/adapter_failures/jsonschema/1-0-*[0].conditions[0].op: does not have a value in the enumeration [Test]
  ```

### Test

To run a small-scale recovery test, outputting both good and failed events into files, execute:

```
snowplow-event-recovery run --config $PWD/scenarios.json -o /tmp -i $PWD/input/ --resolver $PWD/resolver.json
```

The input folder (`--input` or `-i`) contains a line-delimited files (by default `.txt` files are parsed, but the glob extension can be configured using `--glob` or `-g` flag) minimized json failed events as seen in
[example](https://github.com/snowplow-incubator/snowplow-event-recovery/tree/master/examples).

With output being saved into `/tmp` directory as a stringified payload objects
into `good.txt` and json-serialized failed events into `bad.txt`.

Which for successful recovery will print the progress and output summary:
```
Config loaded
Enriching event...
Enriched event 2dfeb9b7-5a87-4214-8a97-a8b23176856b
...
Total Lines: 156, Recovered: 142
```

By default no enrichments are configured, but local-only (ones that do not depend on upstream resource storage) enrichments can be enabled by setting `--enrichments` flag:

```
snowplow-event-recovery run --config $PWD/scenarios.json -o /tmp -i $PWD/input/ --resolver $PWD/resolver.json --enrichments $PWD/enrichments

Total Lines: 3, Recovered: 0
OK! Successfully ran recovery.
```
