This feature is available from version 0.5.0.

To make working with Google Tag Manager and event tracking easier, we created a specific target for Snowtype fitting the way Google Tag Manager handles custom JavaScript code.

A few extra benefits:
- Simple initialization and maintenance.
- Snowtype generated functions are available in `window.__snowtype` for all tags to use.
- Fully typed code documentation using JSDoc.

## Getting Started
To generate code for usage in Google Tag Manager, you should use the option `Google Tag Manager` as the tracker option in your [init](../commands/index.md#snowtype-init) flow or replace your `tracker` and `language` attributes with the following values:

```json
{
    // Rest of the attributes...
    "tracker": "google-tag-manager",
    "language": "javascript-gtm"
}
```

## Using in Google Tag Manager

The code that Snowtype will generate is included in a `snowplow.js` file and, as stated in the file as well, is the code to be **copied and pasted** into a Google Tag Manager [Custom JavaScript variable](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/7683362?hl=en#custom_javascript).

Below you can see the steps you need to create the variable using the contents generated by Snowtype:

### Naming and calling the Custom JavaScript

After selecting a name for the Custom JavaScript variable, you would need to include it in a [Custom HTML](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6107167?hl=en#CustomHTML) tag so that it is executed. Depending on your Google Tag Manager setup, there are a couple, or more, places the variable can be used. An example is a type of Custom HTML tag that runs during page initialization:

```html
<script>
// ... Rest of the initialization code you might have
{{NAME_OF_THE_CREATED_VARIABLE}}
</script>
```

### Using the Snowtype generated code

From there on, after the function has been executed you can access all the functions generated would be available through the `window.__snowtype` object.

For example:
```js
// Example Data Structure
window.__snowtype.trackExample({ ... });

// Or for an Example Event Specification
window.__snowtype.trackExampleSpec({ ... });
```

Keep in mind that at the bottom of the generated file, there are all the JSDoc type definitions required for you to use the functions correctly.
