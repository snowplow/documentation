Historically, most of Snowplowâ€™s Open Source estate was hosted within a [single monorepository](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow), holding the whole history of changes back to inception in 2012. In order to become more flexible and be able to release more regularly, we have since split the monorepository into individual repositories, each containing code for a single application.

One of the benefits of the monorepository and the 'big bang' releases was compatibility assurance. To continue to provide this assurance we now periodically mark a Snowplow platform release with a set of compatible components. These platform release compatibility matrices will updated a few times per year, and we also publish a latest compatibility matrix which describes the latest version of each component that are compatible with one another.

Please watch [Discourse](https://discourse.snowplow.io/c/announcements/new-releases/) or [snowplow/snowplow](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/commits/master) for the individual repositories for updates!
