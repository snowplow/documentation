Welcome to the **example** tutorial.

Tutorials provide step-by-step instructions for implementing Snowplow features. The focus is on Snowplow functionality, rather than business use cases.

Include 1-3 paragraphs about the goal of the tutorial, including links to the relevant docs pages:
  * Who is this for?
  * What will they learn?
  * Why would they want to do this?
  * Roughly how long will it take to follow the tutorial?

Include a diagram or screenshot if it helps explain the purpose of the tutorial.

## Prerequisites

Add a bullet point list of requirements:
  * Does the user need a Snowplow account to follow the tutorial, or can they use Micro or Local?
  * Any specific technical knowledge required?
  * Any other third-party tools required?
