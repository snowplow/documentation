import Badges from '@site/src/components/Badges';
import { Accelerator } from "@site/src/components/AcceleratorAdmonitions";
```

## Requirements

In addition to [dbt](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt) being installed and a web events dataset being available in your database:

- have `snowplow_unified_views` table available as a path (touch points) source (generated by the [snowplow_unified package](/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-models/dbt-unified-data-model/index.md))
- have `snowplow_unified_conversions` table available as a conversions source including the revenue (generated by the optional conversions module of the [snowplow_unified package](/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-models/dbt-unified-data-model/index.md))
- optionally have a spend source table of your choice available which will contain your marketing spend data by channel and or campaign with a timestamp field which denotes the period. This is needed for the ROAS calculation for the drop and recompute report table

## Installation

```mdx-code-block
import DbtPackageInstallation from "@site/docs/reusable/dbt-package-installation/_index.md"

<DbtPackageInstallation package='attribution' fullname='dbtSnowplowAttribution'/>
```

## Setup

### 1. Set variables

Marketing Attribution Analysis can be done in many different ways depending on your business and needs. Our aim has always been to make it flexible for users to make changes from selecting a different data source to reshaping how the customer journey to conversion will be adjusted for the analysis. We suggest taking the time initially, before running the model to understand what setup you would need in order to avoid having to do a full-refresh of the package.

Each of such variables will be explained below, you should edit these in your `dbt_project.yml` file. Further customization can be done via the variables listed in the [configuration page](/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-configuration/attribution/index.mdx).

- `snowplow__attribution_start_date`: The start date in UTC for the package to run. Please bear in mind it will process all paths from the path_source (snowplow_unified_views, unless changed) since this date until the timestamp of the last conversion event in the conversions_source for the first run of the package

Changes to make if not using the default `snowplow_unified` source tables (for path or conversions):
- `snowplow__conversion_path_source`: The source table for the path information. By default it will take values from `{{target.schema ~ '_derived'}}.snowplow_unified_views`
- `snowplow__conversions_source`: The source table for the conversions & revenue information. By default it will take values from `{{target.schema ~ '_derived'}}.snowplow_unified_conversions`
- `snowplow__conversion_hosts`: `url_hosts` to process, if left empty it will include all

Optional changes:
- `snowplow__conversion_clause`: A user defined sql script to filter on specific conversions if needed. Defaulted to 'cv_value > 0'
- `snowplow__path_transforms`: A dictionary of path transforms and their arguments (see [Transform Paths](/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-models/dbt-attribution-data-model/index.md#transform-paths) section)
- `snowplow__spend_source`: The optional source table for the spend information used to calculate ROAS in the `snowplow_attribution_overview`. By default it is empty and will not get processed


```yml title="dbt_project.yml"
vars:
  snowplow_attribution:
    snowplow__attribution_start_date: '2023-01-01'
    snowplow__conversion_path_source: 'my_schema_derived.snowplow_unified_views'
    snowplow__conversions_source: 'my_schema_derived.snowplow_unified_conversions'
    snowplow__conversion_hosts: ['mysite.com']
    snowplow__path_transforms: {'exposure_path' : null}
```
<details>
    <summary>Decide on running optional reporting models</summary>

By default the package creates a View used for BI reporting called `snowplow__enable_attribution_overview`. In case you would like to use the Attribution Modeling Data App (coming soon!), this is not required to be enabled as app will take care of querying this data for you directly.

There is also a `snowplow__enable_paths_to_non_conversion` variable to produce a drop and recompute table for more advanced analysis which is disabled by default. The data app does not yet support recreating the same data, therefore, it needs to be enabled by setting the default variable to `true`.
</details>


### 2. Configure macros

All the below macros are created with the intention to let users modify them to fit their personal use case. If you wish to change this, copy the macro from the macros folder in the `snowplow_attribution` package (e.g. at `[dbt_project_name]/dbt_packages/snowplow_attribution/macros/paths_to_conversion.sql`) and add it to the macros folder of your own dbt project where you are free to make any alterations. You will find a detailed guide / illustration with sample code within the individual macros themselves.

```mdx-code-block
import AttributionDbtMacros from "@site/docs/reusable/attribution-dbt-macros/_index.md"

<AttributionDbtMacros/>
```

### 3. Good-to-know
Please consider the below before running the package as it might help you save time in the long run.

<details>
    <summary>Configuring the spend_source</summary>

To make setting up your attribution modeling package easier, we provided a `snowplow__spend_source` variable which you can use to directly reference a table or view where you store information about your marketing spends. We suggest you just create a view on top of your existing table, making sure you have the following fields in place:

- a timestamp field called `spend_tstamp`
- a varchar/text field callled `channel`
- a varchar/text field callled `channel`
- a numeric field called `spend`

Your channel and spend data will be summed separately in the `attribution_overview` so it should not matter how you structure your data, it is fine to have channel twice for the same period even but do keep in mind that the model will not apply any deduplication.

<details>
    <summary>Running both Unified and Attribution dbt packages from the same project</summary>
Although auto-deployed packages managed via Console run in separate projects, for others there may be use cases when it is more practical to run both the [Unified Digital](/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-models/dbt-unified-data-model/index.md) and Attribution dbt packages from the same project. We purposefully did not directly link the two packages and this method of running is non-standard but there is a way to make it work. When specifying the sources just make sure you change the default source references to: ref('')  instead of hard coding the schema.table_name for these variables:

```yml
snowplow__conversion_path_source: "{{ ref(snowplow_unified_views') }}"
snowplow__conversions_source: "{{ ref('snowplow_unified_conversions' }}"
```

Keep in mind that the manifest tables are still not linked, therefore both projects' statefulness is dictated by their own set of tables and values.
</details>



### 4. Run the model

Execute the following either through your CLI, within dbt Cloud, or within [Snowplow BDP](/docs/modeling-your-data/running-data-models-via-snowplow-bdp/dbt/index.md)

```yml
dbt run --select snowplow_attribution
```
