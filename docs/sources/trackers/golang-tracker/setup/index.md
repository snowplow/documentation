## Tracker compatibility

<p>The latest version of the Snowplow Golang Tracker is v{versions.golangTracker} which has been built and tested using Golang versions <code>1.19.x</code>, <code>1.18.x</code> and <code>1.17.x</code>.</p>

## Setup

All of the tracker code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-golang-tracker) and versions can be fetched using Golang modules with both `v2` and `v3` available via this method.

To get the package, execute:

```bash
$host go get "github.com/snowplow/snowplow-golang-tracker/v3/tracker"
```

To import the package, add the following line to your code:

```go
import "github.com/snowplow/snowplow-golang-tracker/v3/tracker"
```
