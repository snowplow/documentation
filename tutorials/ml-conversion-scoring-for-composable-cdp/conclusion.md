Congratulations! You've finished the build ML conversion scoring for composable CDP tutorial.

You have successfully built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that transforms raw behavioral data into actionable marketing insights. Your composable CDP now enables you to:

## What you've accomplished

1. **Built predictive models** - Created machine learning models that accurately predict conversion likelihood using rich behavioral features from Snowplow
2. **Activated high-value audiences** - Connected your propensity scores to Census and synchronized targeted audiences with your marketing tools
3. **Measured campaign performance** - Established attribution tracking and reporting that demonstrates the ROI of ML-driven targeting
4. **Created a scalable system** - Set up infrastructure that can continuously improve targeting as you collect more behavioral data

## Business impact

Your ML-driven composable CDP delivers measurable business value:

- **Higher conversion rates** by targeting users with the highest propensity to convert
- **Lower customer acquisition costs** through more efficient ad spend allocation
- **Better attribution insights** with complete visibility into campaign performance
- **Scalable personalization** that improves as your dataset grows

## Next steps

Now that you have a working composable CDP foundation, consider some advanced implementations.

### Advanced ML capabilities
- Build models for different conversion events (demo requests, trial signups, purchases)
- Implement churn prediction models to identify at-risk customers
- Create customer lifetime value predictions to optimize retention campaigns
- Experiment with more sophisticated feature engineering and model architectures

### Enhanced activation strategies
- Set up real-time model serving for immediate personalization
- Create dynamic audiences that automatically adjust based on model performance
- Implement multi-touch attribution models for more accurate campaign measurement
- Build lookalike audiences based on your highest-converting user segments

### Operational excellence
- Implement model monitoring and drift detection
- Set up automated model retraining pipelines
- Create alerting for model performance degradation
- Establish A/B testing frameworks for model comparison

### Expanded data integration
- Integrate additional data sources (CRM, support tickets, product usage)
- Build unified customer profiles across all touchpoints
- Implement cross-channel attribution and journey analysis
- Create data governance frameworks for responsible ML deployment

The foundation you've built provides the architecture for sophisticated, data-driven marketing that scales with your business and continuously improves campaign performance through machine learning.
