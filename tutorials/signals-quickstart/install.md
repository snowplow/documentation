title: Install the SDK

Choose where to store your Signals configurations. We recommend creating a new repository.

The easiest way to use the Python SDK is within a Jupyter notebook.

## Install the Python SDK

Within your notebook, install the SDK.

```bash
pip install snowplow-signals
```

Once installed, you can start to define your configuration components. To test or apply your configuration, or retrieve calculated attributes from the Profiles Store, you'll need to connect to your Signals deployment.

## Connect to Signals

To connect to Signals, you will need 4 values:

| Value           | Description                             | Where to get it                 | Format                            |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Signals API URL | The API URL for your Signals deployment | Provided by Snowplow            | `https://{{UUID}}.svc.snplow.net` |
| API key         | A Snowplow API key                      | Generated by you in BDP Console | UUID                              |
| API key ID      | A Snowplow API key ID                   | Generated by you in BDP Console | UUID                              |
| Organization ID | Your Snowplow organization ID           | Part of your BDP Console URL    | UUID                              |

This image shows how to find your organization ID:

Follow the instructions in [Account management](/docs/account-management/) to generate your API key and key ID.

Add these four tokens to your environment or notebook secrets.

Create a `Signals` object by passing in the required values. This example shows how to access notebook secrets, assuming you gave them these names:

```python
from snowplow_signals import Signals

sp_signals = Signals(
    api_url=userdata.get('SP_API_URL'),
    api_key=userdata.get('SP_API_KEY'),
    api_key_id=userdata.get('SP_API_KEY_ID'),
    org_id=userdata.get('SP_ORG_ID'),
)
```
