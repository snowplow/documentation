In this tutorial, you:
* Installed and configured the Snowplow CLI with an MCP-compatible AI assistant
* Learned how to create and validate data structures using natural language prompts
* Built complete data products including events, entities, and source applications
* Published your locally created structures to Snowplow Console

## Next steps

* Read the [Snowplow CLI documentation](/docs/data-product-studio/snowplow-cli) for further workflows and commands
* Follow the [Snowplow CLI Git tutorial](/tutorials/data-structures-in-git/introduction) to manage your tracking plans with Git version control
* Check out our [tracking design best practise guide](/docs/fundamentals/tracking-design-best-practice)
