The Snowplow Node.js Tracker allows you to track Snowplow events from your Node.js applications.

The tracker should be straightforward to use if you are comfortable with JavaScript development; any prior experience with other Snowplow trackers is helpful but not necessary. It is written in TypeScript.

<p>The Node.js tracker, along with the <a href="/docs/sources/trackers/web-trackers/index.md">web trackers</a>, are part of <a href="https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-javascript-tracker">one monorepo</a>. The current version is {versions.javaScriptTracker}.</p>
