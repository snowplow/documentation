You may wish to track events which are not directly supported by Snowplow and which [structured event tracking](/docs/events/custom-events/structured-events/index.md) does not adequately capture. Your event may have more than the five fields offered by `Structured` events, or its fields may not fit into the category-action-label-property-value model. The solution is Snowplow’s self-describing events. Self-describing events are a [data structure based on JSON Schemas](/docs/fundamentals/schemas/index.md) and can have arbitrarily many fields.

To define your own custom event, you will need to [create a corresponding schema](/docs/event-studio/data-structures/manage/index.md). Snowplow uses the schema to validate that the JSON containing the event properties is well-formed.
