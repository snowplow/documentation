## Final Notes and Next Steps

This tutorial walked you through the process of building a prospect scoring system using Snowplow Signals together with a machine learning model.
It is a starting point in exploring and using Signals APIs for your own needs.

Suggested **next steps**:

- **Define More Signals Attributes:** Define more Signals attributes custom-tailored for your use cases and events.
- **Integrate Attributes into your Flows:** Integrate Signals APIs into your backend workflows to act on the users attributes.
- **Explore More Signals Use Cases and Docs:** Explore Signals Documentation to get more ideas on how to integrate Signals capabilities into your use cases.



### End Result

At the end of the tutorial, you will:

* see live prospect attribute updates in the browser console,
* score them using an ML model,
* and use the outputs to drive decisions on the website.

<!--
In this tutorial you've learned how to use Signals to calculate and serve information about user behavior in near real time.

This is the process workflow:
* Define attributes
* Test definitions
* Apply attribute configurations to Signals
* Retrieve calculated attribute values from the Profiles Store

## Next steps

Here are some ideas for further exploration:
* Try out other entities, e.g. `domain_userid`, to calculate the attributes against
* Define attributes based off other event types
* Retrieve calculated attributes in your real applications
* Explore our other Signals tutorials -->
