Snowplow allows you to collect events via the [webhooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) of supported third-party software.

Webhooks allow this third-party software to send their own internal event streams to Snowplow Collectors for further processing. Webhooks are sometimes referred to as "streaming APIs" or "HTTP response APIs".

## 1\. Choose and configure a Webhook

The following Webhooks are currently available for setup:

```mdx-code-block
import Block2941 from "@site/docs/reusable/untitled-reusable-block-39/_index.md"

<Block2941/>
```

If you are interested in sponsoring a new webhook integration for Snowplow, [let us know](https://snowplowanalytics.com/contact-us/).
