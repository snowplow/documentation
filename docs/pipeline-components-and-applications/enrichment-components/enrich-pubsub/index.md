`enrich-pubsub` is a standalone JVM application that reads from and writes to PubSub topics.
It can be run from anywhere, as long as it has permissions to access the topics.

It is published on Docker Hub and can be run with the following command:

<CodeBlock language="bash">{
`docker run \\
  -it --rm \\
  -v $PWD:/snowplow \\
  -e GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/snowplow/snowplow-gcp-account-11aa55ff6b1b.json \\
  snowplow/snowplow-enrich-pubsub:${versions.enrich} \\
  --enrichments /snowplow/enrichments \\
  --iglu-config /snowplow/resolver.json \\
  --config /snowplow/config.hocon
`}</CodeBlock>

Above assumes that you have following directory structure:

1. GCP credentials [JSON file](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started)
2. `enrichments` directory, (possibly empty) with all [enrichment configuration JSONs](/docs/getting-started-on-snowplow-open-source/setup-snowplow-on-gcp/setup-validation-and-enrich/add-additional-enrichments/index.md)
3. Iglu Resolver [configuration JSON](/docs/pipeline-components-and-applications/iglu/iglu-resolver/index.md)
4. enrich-pubSub [configuration HOCON](/docs/pipeline-components-and-applications/enrichment-components/configuration-reference/index.md)

It is possible to use environment variables in all of the above.

Alternatively, you can download and runÂ [a jar file from the github release](https://github.com/snowplow/enrich/releases).

<CodeBlock language="bash">{
`java -jar snowplow-enrich-pubsub-${versions.enrich}.jar \\
  --enrichments /snowplow/enrichments \\
  --iglu-config /snowplow/resolver.json \\
  --config /snowplow/config.hocon
`}</CodeBlock>
