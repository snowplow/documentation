Snowplow enables you to collect events via the webhooks of supported third-party software.

Webhooks allow the third-party software to send their own internal event streams to your Snowplow collector for further processing. Webhooks are sometimes referred to as "streaming APIs" or "HTTP response APIs".

View our [set of trackers for tracking events from your own applications](/docs/sources/trackers/index.md).
