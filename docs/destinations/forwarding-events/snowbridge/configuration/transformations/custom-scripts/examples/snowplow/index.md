# Snowplow data

For this example, the input data is a valid Snowplow TSV event - so we can enable `snowplow_mode`, which will convert the data to a JSON before passing it to the script as a JSON object.

The script below filters out non-web data, based on the `platform` value, otherwise it checks for a `user_id` value, setting a new `uid` field to that value if it's found, or `domain_userid` if not.

It also sets the partitionKey to `app_id`.

The configuration for this script is:
