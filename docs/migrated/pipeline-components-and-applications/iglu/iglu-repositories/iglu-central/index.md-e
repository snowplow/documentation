[Iglu Central](http://iglucentral.com/) is a public repository of JSON Schemas hosted by Snowplow Analytics.

As far as we know, Iglu Central is the first public **machine-readable** schema repository - all prior efforts we have seen are human-browsable directories of articles about schemas (e.g. [schema.org](http://schema.org/)).

Think of Iglu Central as like [RubyGems.org](http://rubygems.org/) or [Maven Central](http://central.maven.org/) but for storing publically-available JSON Schemas.

Under the hood, Iglu Central is built and run as a static Iglu repository, which is simply an Iglu repository server structured as a static website serving its whole content over http, and is hosted on Amazon S3.

The [deployment process](https://docs.snowplowanalytics.com/docs/pipeline-components-and-applications/iglu/iglu-central-setup/) for Iglu Central is documented on this wiki in case a user wants to setup a public mirror or private instance of Iglu Central.

Iglu Central is available for view at [http://iglucentral.com](http://iglucentral.com/). Although Iglu Central is primarily designed to be consumed by [Iglu clients](https://docs.snowplowanalytics.com/docs/pipeline-components-and-applications/iglu/iglu-clients/), the root index page for Iglu Central links to all schemas currently hosted on Iglu Central.

The schemas for Iglu Central are stored in GitHub, in [snowplow/iglu-central](https://github.com/snowplow/iglu-central).

Some components of Snowplow require an Iglu Server, and a static repo will not work. This means you'll want to host a mirror of Iglu Central. You can mirror Iglu Central using `[igluctl](https://docs.snowplowanalytics.com/docs/pipeline-components-and-applications/iglu/igluctl)`:

```
git clone https://github.com/snowplow/iglu-central
cd iglu-central
igluctl static push --public schemas/ http://CHANGE-TO-MY-IGLU-URL.elb.amazonaws.com 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```
