Each section of the accelerator should have its own page:
* Title in imperative case
* Start with 1-2 paragraphs explaining the goal of the section
* Include links to the relevant docs pages or source code

## First step

One section page can have multiple steps, separated by headings.

## Second step

For each step:
* Explain what the purpose is
* Provide instructions of how to do it
* Use code blocks and screenshots where appropriate
* For code they need to run, include instructions on where to run it
* State and/or show the expected outcome

## Troubleshooting

If you know of any issues that users are likely to encounter while following the section, include them here.
