The Snowplow Rust Tracker allows you to add analytics to your Rust apps.

The tracker is published on crates.io asÂ [snowplow_tracker](https://crates.io/crates/snowplow_tracker).

:::caution Migration from 0.1.0

If you are upgrading from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0, there are a couple of changes required to make to your code:

- [`Tracker.track`](./getting-started/index.md#tracking-events) is no longer an async function
- The Emitter must be safely closed to allow the tracker to drop, as it spawns a thread to send events. This can be done by calling `Tracker.close_emitter()`.
