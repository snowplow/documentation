## Snowplow offerings

You can choose between Snowplow BDP Enterprise (paid, hosted in your cloud), Snowplow BDP Cloud (paid, hosted by Snowplow) and Snowplow Community Edition (free, hosted in your cloud). See the [feature comparison page](/docs/get-started/feature-comparison/index.md), as well as the [deployment model page](/docs/get-started/deployment-model/index.md) for more information.

Each offering has its own setup guide:
* [Snowplow BDP Enterprise](/docs/get-started/snowplow-bdp/private-managed-cloud/index.md)
* [Snowplow BDP Cloud](/docs/get-started/snowplow-bdp/cloud/index.md)
* [Snowplow Community Edition](/docs/get-started/snowplow-community-edition/index.md)

## Snowplow Micro

While not a full substitute for a real Snowplow pipeline, [Snowplow Micro](/docs/data-product-studio/data-quality/snowplow-micro/index.md) could be a quick way to get a feel for how Snowplow works for more technical users. Note that Micro does not store data in any warehouse or database, but you will be able to look at the available fields.
