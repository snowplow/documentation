### Setting Up Your Cloud

Whether you are just getting started with your first Snowplow pipeline or would like to add additional data pipelines, you need to configure your Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environment to allow Snowplow to deploy and manage the pipeline(s) on your behalf.

Follow the links below for guidance on what is necessary to configure. The process shouldn't take too long, but it will need to be done by someone with the appropriate permission levels to configure the cloud environment.

Once you've set up your cloud environment, you can request the new pipeline to be added via the Snowplow BDP user interface:

- [Request a pipeline on AWS](https://console.snowplowanalytics.com/pipelines/AWS/new)
- [Request a pipeline on GCP](https://console.snowplowanalytics.com/pipelines/gcp/new)
