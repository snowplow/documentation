If you are using [Stream Enrich](/docs/pipeline-components-and-applications/enrichment-components/stream-enrich/index.md) to write enriched Snowplow events to one stream and bad events to another, you can use the Elasticsearch Loader to read events from either of those streams and write them to [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/). It works with either Kinesis or NSQ streams.

When loading enriched events, the resulting JSONs are like the [Snowplow Canonical Event model](/docs/understanding-your-pipeline/canonical-event/index.md) with the following changes:

### Boolean fields reformatted

All boolean fields like `br_features_java` are either `"0"` or `"1"` in the canonical event model. The JSON converts these values to `false` and `true`.

### New `geo_location` field

The `geo_latitude` and `geo_longitude` fields are combined into a single `geo_location` field of Elasticsearch's ["geo_point" type](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/geo-point.html).

### Unstructured events

Unstructured events are expanded into full JSONs. For example, the event

```json
{
    "schema": "iglu:com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow/link_click/jsonschema/1-0-1",
    "data": {
        "targetUrl": "http://snowplowanalytics.com/analytics/index.html",
        "elementId": "action",
        "elementClasses": [],
        "elementTarget": ""
	}
}
```

would be converted to the field

```json
{
    "unstruct_com_snowplowanalytics_snowplow_link_click_1": {
        "targetUrl": "http://snowplowanalytics.com/analytics/index.html",
        "elementId": "action",
        "elementClasses": [],
        "elementTarget": ""
    }
}
```

### Custom contexts

Each custom context in an array is similarly expanded to a JSON with its own field. For example, the array

```json
[
    {
        "schema": "iglu:com.acme/contextOne/jsonschema/1-0-0",
        "data": {
            "key": "value"
        }
    }
    {
        "schema": "iglu:com.acme/contextTwo/jsonschema/3-0-0",
        "data": {
            "name": "second"
        }
    }
]
```

would be converted to

```json
{
    "contexts_com_acme_context_one_1": {
        "key": "value"
    },
    "contexts_com_acme_context_two_3": {
        "name": "second"
    }
}
```

## Setup guide

### Configuring Elasticsearch

#### Getting started

First off, install and set up Elasticsearch version 7.x or 6.x. For more information check out the [installation guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/_installation.html).

#### Raising the file limit

Elasticsearch keeps a lot of files open simultaneously so you will need to increase the maximum number of files a user can have open. To do this:

```bash
sudo vim /etc/security/limits.conf
```

Append the following lines to the file:

```bash
{{USERNAME}} soft nofile 32000
{{USERNAME}} hard nofile 32000
```

Where {{USERNAME}} is the name of the user running Elasticsearch. You will need to logout and restart Elasticsearch before the new file limit takes effect.

To check that this new limit has taken effect you can run the following command from the terminal:

```bash
curl localhost:9200/_nodes/process?pretty
```

If the `max_file_descriptors` equals 32000 it is running with the new limit.

#### Defining the mapping

Use the following request to create the mapping with Elasticsearch 7.x:

```bash
curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/snowplow' -d '{
    "settings": {
        "analysis": {
            "analyzer": {
                "default": {
                    "type": "keyword"
                }
            }
        }
    },
    "mappings": {
        "properties": {
            "geo_location": {
                "type": "geo_point"
            }
        }
    }
}'
```

Note that [mapping types are removed](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/removal-of-types.html) starting from Elasticsearch 7.0.0. If you use any older version, you might need to include mapping type also.

This initialization sets the default analyzer to "keyword". This means that string fields will not be split into separate tokens for the purposes of searching. This saves space and ensures that URL fields are handled correctly.

If you want to tokenize specific string fields, you can change the "properties" field in the mapping like this:

```bash
curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/snowplow' -d '{
    "settings": {
        "analysis": {
            "analyzer": {
                "default": {
                    "type": "keyword"
                }
            }
        }
    },
    "mappings": {
        "properties": {
            "geo_location": {
                "type": "geo_point"
            },
            "field_to_tokenize": {
                "type": "string",
                "analyzer": "english"
            }
        }
    }
}'
```

### Installing the Elasticsearch Loader

The Elasticsearch Loader is published on Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull snowplow/snowplow-elasticsearch-loader:2.0.7
```

The container can be run with the following command:

```bash
docker run \
  -v /path/to/config.hocon:/snowplow/config.hocon \
  snowplow/snowplow-elasticsearch-loader:2.0.7 \
  --config /snowplow/config.hocon
```

Alternatively you can download and run a [jar file from the github release](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-elasticsearch-loader/releases):

```bash
java -jar snowplow-elasticsearch-loader-2.0.7.jar --config /path/to/config.hocon
```
