The Snowplow JavaScript Tracker can now be deployed directly to Google Tag Manager via a Custom Template. This is available in the [Tag Manager Template Gallery](https://tagmanager.google.com/gallery/#/owners/snowplow/templates/snowplow-gtm-custom-template).

There are two templates that you will need to use when setting up the Snowplow Custom Template.

1. Snowplow Analytics Settings
2. Snowplow Analytics

Snowplow Analytics Settings Template: A variable template which can be used to easily apply a set of tracker configuration parameters to tags created with the Snowplow Analytics tag template.

Snowplow Analytics Template: Load, configure, and deploy the Snowplow JavaScript tracker library. It supports the full functionality of the JavaScript SDK.
