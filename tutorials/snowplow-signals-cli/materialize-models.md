> ⚠️ This feature is currently under development and will be available in a future release.

## What is Model Materialization?

Model materialization is the process of taking your tested and validated dbt models and making them available in your Snowplow Signals feature store. This enables you to:

- Serve your features in production
- Schedule regular updates
- Monitor feature performance
- Manage feature metadata

## Coming Features

When this feature is released, you'll be able to:

1. Create batch sources directly from your dbt models
2. Configure automatic ingestion schedules

## Why This Matters

Materializing your models to the feature store is crucial because it:

- Bridges the gap between development and production
- Ensures consistent feature serving
