Documentation for latest release

The documentation listed here is for Version 2 of the JavaScript Tracker. Version 3 is now available and upgrading is recommended.

\- [Documentation for Version 3](/docs/collecting-data/collecting-from-own-applications/javascript-trackers/index.md)

\- [v2 to v3 Migration Guide](/docs/collecting-data/collecting-from-own-applications/javascript-trackers/javascript-tracker/v2-to-v3-migration-guide/index.md)

The JavaScript Tracker supports both synchronous and asynchronous tags. We recommend the asynchronous tags in nearly all instances, as these do not slow down page load times.
