You can run this accelerator using Microsoft Development Containers (DevContainers) or Docker Compose. We recommend using DevContainers as it provides more flexibilityâ€”you can run this accelerator entirely in the cloud using GitHub Codespaces, or locally on your machine using VS Code or the DevContainers CLI.

## Using DevContainers

Docker is still used to run the components inside the DevContainer.
