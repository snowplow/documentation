## Overview

The Snowplow Analytics SDKs are designed for data engineers and data scientists working with Snowplow in a number of languages.

Some good use cases for the SDKs include:

1. Transforming the Enriched TSV to Enriched JSON for further processing
2. Developing AI/ML models on your event data
3. Performing analytics-on-write in AWS Lambda as part of our Kinesis real-time pipeline
4. Within Snowplow pipeline components to process event data

## Snowplow Analytics SDKs

- [Scala Analytics SDK](/docs/api-reference/analytics-sdk/analytics-sdk-scala/index.md) - lets you work with Snowplow enriched events in your Scala event processing, data modeling and machine-learning jobs. You can use this SDK with Apache Spark, AWS Lambda, GCP Cloud Functions, Apache Flink and other Scala-compatible data processing frameworks.
- [JavaScript and TypeScript Analytics SDK](/docs/api-reference/analytics-sdk/analytics-sdk-javascript/index.md) - lets you work with Snowplow enriched events in your Node.js or other JavaScript environments. This SDK can be used with AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions.
- [Go Analytics SDK](/docs/api-reference/analytics-sdk/analytics-sdk-go/index.md) - lets you work with Snowplow enriched events in your Go environments. This SDK can be used with AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions.
- [Python Analytics SDK](/docs/api-reference/analytics-sdk/analytics-sdk-python/index.md) - lets you work with Snowplow enriched events in your Python event processing, data modeling and machine-learning jobs. You can use this SDK with Apache Spark, AWS Lambda, GCP Cloud Functions and other Python-compatible data processing frameworks.
- [.NET Analytics SDK](/docs/api-reference/analytics-sdk/analytics-sdk-net/index.md) - lets you work with Snowplow enriched events in your .NET event processing, data modeling and machine-learning jobs. You can use this SDK with Azure Data Lake Analytics, Azure Function, AWS Lambda, GCP Cloud Functions other .NET-compatible data processing frameworks.
