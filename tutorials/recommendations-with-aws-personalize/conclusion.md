# Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have explored the **AWS Personalize** solution accelerator for feeding AWS Personalize with Snowplow data, enabling customers to update recommendations for their end-users in real-time. 

## Key Takeaways

### Understanding the Process

We successfully have built a real-time system for processing event data including:

- Initial training data for AWS Personalize, to jump-start a base recommendation system with seminal data;
- Continuously feeding AWS Personalization recommendation engine with new data once this new data is generated in real-time.

### Practical Applications

This tutorial can be extended to utilize Snowplow event data for other real-time use cases, such as:

- Web Engagement analytics;
- Ad performance tracking.

## Next Steps
- **Extend tracking:** Extend the solution to track more granular user interactions or track on a new platform such as mobile;
- **Expanding use cases:** AWS Personalize can be used not just for recommendations, but also for hyperpersonalization based on customers' history.

By completing this tutorial, you are equipped to harness the power of event-driven systems and Snowplow’s analytics framework to build dynamic, real-time solutions tailored to your streaming and analytics needs.
