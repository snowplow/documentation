Snowplow events have multiple timestamps that are added as the payload moves through the pipeline. The set of timestamps is designed to account for devices with incorrectly set clocks, or delays in event sending due to network outages.

The timestamps are:

| Timestamp             | Added by                                                                            | Description                                                                                                                                                            | In all events |

The `load_tstamp` is added either by the Loader or by the warehouse at the point of loading, depending on the Loader/warehouse. Use this timestamp for incremental processing.

## Derived timestamp

The `derived_tstamp` corrects for inaccurate timestamps and delays.

It's calculated as `collector_tstamp` minus the difference between the `dvce_sent_tstamp` and the `dvce_created_tstamp`. Alternatively, if `true_tstamp` is available, `derived_tstamp` is the same as `true_tstamp`.

The calculation has two assumptions:
* We assume that, although `dvce_created_tstamp` and `dvce_sent_tstamp` can both be inaccurate, they're inaccurate in precisely the same way. If the device clock is 15 minutes fast at event creation, then it remains 15 minutes fast at event sending, whenever that might be.
* We assume that the time taken for an event to get from the device to the Collector is neglible, i.e. the lag between `dvce_sent_tstamp` and `collector_tstamp` is 0 seconds.

## What timestamp to use?

The choice of timestamp for downstream analysis depends on how you're using the data.

For reporting, we recommend using the `derived_tstamp`. Our data models use `derived_tstamp` as the default `start_tstamp` for creating derived tables.

To filter the `atomic.events` table directly, use the timestamp it's partitioned on. For example, if your warehouse is partitioned by `load_tstamp`, then use clauses like `WHERE load_tstamp > ?` in your analysis.

The `refr_device_tstamp` timestamp can help you understand cross-domain navigation by your users.

All of the timestamps can also be used for custom use cases, or in debugging, to closely follow how the events are created and move through the pipeline.
