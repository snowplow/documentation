Snowplow allows you to collect events via the [webhooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) of supported third-party software.

Webhooks allow this third-party software to send their own internal event streams to [Snowplow Collectors](/docs/getting-started-on-snowplow-open-source/setup-snowplow-on-gcp/setup-the-snowplow-collector/index.md) for further processing. Webhooks are sometimes referred to as "streaming APIs" or "HTTP response APIs".

## 1. Choose and configure a Webhook

The following Webhooks are currently available for setup:

```mdx-code-block
import Block2941 from "@site/docs/reusable/untitled-reusable-block-39/_index.md"

<Block2941/>
```
