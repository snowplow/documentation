This is a complete list of the options that can be configured in the collector HOCON config file. The [example configs in github](https://github.com/snowplow/stream-collector/tree/master/examples) show how to prepare an input file. Some features are described in more detail at the bottom of this page.

### Common options

| `collector.crossDomain.enabled`                                | Optional. Default: `false`. If enabled, `/crossdomain.xml` endpoint returns a cross domain policy file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `collector.crossDomain.domains`                                | Optional. Default: `[*]` meaning the cross domain policy file allows all domains. This can also be changed to a list of domains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| `collector.cookie.enabled`                                     | Optional. Default: `true`. The collector sets a cookie to set the user's network user id. Changing this to `false` disables setting cookies. Regardless of this setting, if the collector receives a request with the custom `SP-Anonymous:*` header, no cookie will be set. You can control whether this header is set or not in your tracking implementation. |
| `collector.cookie.expiration`                                  | Optional. Default: `365 days`. Expiry of the collector's cookie.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `collector.cookie.name`                                        | Optional. Default: `sp`.

| `collector.cookie.domains`                                     | Optional. Default: no domains. There is more details about this feature below. This is for fine control over the cookie's domain attribute.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `collector.cookie.fallbackDomain`                              | Optional. If set, the fallback domain will be used for the cookie if none of the `Origin` header hosts matches the list of cookie domains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `collector.cookie.secure`                                      | Optional. Default: `true`.

| `collector.cookie.httpOnly`                                    | Optional. Default: `true`. Sets the `httpOnly` property of the cookie.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `collector.cookie.sameSite`                                    | Optional. Default: `None`. Sets the `sameSite` property of the cookie. Possible values: `Strict`, `Lax`, `None`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `collector.doNotTrackCookie.enabled`                           | Optional. Default: `false`. If enabled, the collector respects a "do not track" cookie. If the cookie is present, it returns a `200` status code but it does not log the request to the output queue.                                                                                                                                                           |

### Setting the domain name

Set the cookie name using the `collector.cookie.name` setting. To maintain backward compatibility with earlier versions of the collector, use the string "sp" as the cookie name.

The collector responds to valid requests with a `Set-Cookie` header, which may or may not specify a `domain` for the cookie.

If no domain is specified, the cookie will be set against the full collector domain, for example `collector.snplow.com`. That will mean that applications running elsewhere on `*.snplow.com` won't be able to access it. If you don't need to grant access to the cookie from other applications on the domain, then you can ignore the `domains` and `fallbackDomain` settings.

In earlier versions, you could specify a `domain` to tie the cookie to. For example, if set to `.snplow.com`, the cookie would have been accessible to other applications running on `*.snplow.com`. To do the same in this version, use the `fallbackDomain` setting but **make sure** that you no longer include a leading dot:

```properties
fallbackDomain = "snplow.com"
```

The cookie set by the collector can be treated differently by browsers, depending on whether it's considered to be a first-party or a third-party cookie. In earlier versions (0.15.0 and earlier), if you had two collector endpoints, one on `collector.snplow.com` and one on `collector.snplow.net`, you could only specify one of those domains in the configuration. That meant that you were only able to set a first-party cookie server-side on either `.snplow.com` or `.snplow.net`, but not on both. From version 0.16.0, you can specify a list of domains to be used for the cookie (**note the lack of a leading dot**):

```properties
domains = [
  "snplow.com"
  "snplow.net"
]
```

Which domain to be used in the `Set-Cookie` header is determined by matching the domains from the `Origin` header of the request to the specified list. The first match is used. If no matches are found, the fallback domain will be used, if configured. If no `fallbackDomain` is configured, the cookie will be tied to the full collector domain.

If you specify a main domain in the list, all subdomains on it will be matched. If you specify a subdomain, only that subdomain will be matched.

Examples:

- `domain.com` will match `Origin` headers like `domain.com`, `www.domain.com` and `secure.client.domain.com`
- `client.domain.com` will match an `Origin` header like `secure.client.domain.com` but not `domain.com` or `www.domain.com`.

### Configuring custom paths

The collector responds with a cookie to requests with a path that matches the `vendor/version` protocol. The expected values are:

- `com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow/tp2` for Tracker Protocol 2
- `r/tp2` for redirects
- `com.snowplowanalytics.iglu/v1` for the Iglu Webhook.

You can also map any valid (ie, two-segment) path to one of the three defaults via the `collector.paths` section of the configuration file. Your custom path must be the key and the value must be one of the corresponding default paths. Both must be full valid paths starting with a leading slash:

```properties
paths {
  "/com.acme/track"    = "/com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow/tp2"
  "/com.acme/redirect" = "/r/tp2"
  "/com.acme/iglu"     = "/com.snowplowanalytics.iglu/v1"
}
```

### TLS port binding and certificate (2.4.0+)

Since 2.4.0 TLS certificates are configured using JVM system parameters. The "`Customizing JSSE`" section in [Java 11 JSSE reference documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/security/java-secure-socket-extension-jsse-reference-guide.html#GUID-A41282C3-19A3-400A-A40F-86F4DA22ABA9) explains all system properties in detail.

The following JVM properties are the ones to be used most of the time.

| System Property | Customized Item | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `javax.net.ssl.keyStore` | Default keystore; see [Customizing the Default Keystores and Truststores, Store Types, and Store Passwords](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/security/java-secure-socket-extension-jsse-reference-guide.html#GUID-7D9F43B8-AABF-4C5B-93E6-3AFB18B66150) | None |   |
| `javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword` | Default keystore password; see [Customizing the Default Keystores and Truststores, Store Types, and Store Passwords](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/security/java-secure-socket-extension-jsse-reference-guide.html#GUID-7D9F43B8-AABF-4C5B-93E6-3AFB18B66150) | None | It is inadvisable to specify the password in a way that exposes it to discovery by other users. **Password can not be empty.** |
| `javax.net.ssl.keyStoreType` | Default keystore type; see [Customizing the Default Keystores and Truststores, Store Types, and Store Passwords](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/security/java-secure-socket-extension-jsse-reference-guide.html#GUID-7D9F43B8-AABF-4C5B-93E6-3AFB18B66150) | `PKCS12` |    |
| `jdk.tls.server.cipherSuites` | Server-side default enabled cipher suites. See [Specifying Default Enabled Cipher Suites](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/security/java-secure-socket-extension-jsse-reference-guide.html#GUID-D61663E8-2405-4B2D-A1F1-B8C7EA2688DB) | See [SunJSSE Cipher Suites](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/security/oracle-providers.html#GUID-7093246A-31A3-4304-AC5F-5FB6400405E2__SUNJSSE_CIPHER_SUITES) to determine which cipher suites are enabled by default | Caution: These system properties can be used to configure weak cipher suites, or the configured cipher suites may be weak in the future. It is not recommended that you use these system properties without understanding the risks. |
| `jdk.tls.server.protocols` | Default handshaking protocols for TLS/DTLS servers. See [The SunJSSE Provider](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/security/oracle-providers.html#GUID-7093246A-31A3-4304-AC5F-5FB6400405E2) | None | To configure the default enabled protocol suite in the server-side of a SunJSSE provider, specify the protocols in a comma-separated list within quotation marks. The protocols in this list are standard SSL protocol names as described in [Java Security Standard Algorithm Names](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/specs/security/standard-names.html). Note that this System Property impacts only the default protocol suite (SSLContext of the algorithms SSL, TLS and DTLS). If an application uses a version-specific SSLContext (SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3, DTLSv1.0, or DTLSv1.2), or sets the enabled protocol version explicitly, this System Property has no impact. |

A deployment would need a TLS certificate, preferably issued by a trusted CA, however, for test purposes, a TLS cert could be generated as follows

```bash
ssl_dir=/opt/snowplow/ssl
mkdir -p ${ssl_dir}

sudo openssl req \
  -x509 \
  -newkey rsa:4096 \
  -keyout ${ssl_dir}/collector_key.pem \
  -out ${ssl_dir}/collector_cert.pem \
  -days 3650 \
  -nodes \
  -subj "/C=UK/O=Acme/OU=DevOps/CN=*.acme.com"

sudo openssl pkcs12 \
  -export \
  -out ${ssl_dir}/collector.p12 \
  -inkey ${ssl_dir}/collector_key.pem \
  -in ${ssl_dir}/collector_cert.pem \
  -passout pass:changeme

sudo chmod 644 ${ssl_dir}/collector.p12
```

and then the collector (kinesis as example) could be started as follows

```bash
config_dir=/opt/snowplow/config

docker run \
  -d \
  --name scala-stream-collector \
  --restart always \
  --network host \
  -v ${config_dir}:/snowplow/config \
  -v ${ssl_dir}:/snowplow/ssl \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -p 8443:8443 \
  -e 'JAVA_OPTS=-Xms2g -Xmx2g -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStoreType=pkcs12 -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=changeme -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=/snowplow/ssl/collector.p12 -Dorg.slf4j.simpleLogger.defaultLogLevel=warn -Dcom.amazonaws.sdk.disableCbor' \
  snowplow/scala-stream-collector-kinesis:2.5.0 \
  --config /snowplow/config/snowplow-stream-collector-kinesis-2.5.0.hocon
```

Note: If you don't have a verified certificate, you need to disable SSL verification on client side. e.g. `cURL`'s `-k, --insecure` flag disables it.

### Setting up an SQS buffer (2.0.0+)

The lack of auto-scaling in Kinesis results in throttled streams in case of traffic spikes and Stream Collector starts accumulating events to retry them later. If accumulation continues long enough, Stream Collector will run out of memory. To prevent the possibility of a broken collector, we decided to make it possible to configure an SQS buffer that can provide additional assurance during extreme traffic spikes.

SQS is used to queue any message that Stream Collector failed to send to the Kinesis and the [`sqs2kinesis` application](/docs/pipeline-components-and-applications/sqs2kinesis/index.md) is then responsible for reading the messages from SQS and writing to Kinesis once it is ready. In the event of any AWS API glitches, there is a retry mechanism which retries sending the SQS queue 10 times.

The keys set up for the Kinesis stream are stored as SQS message attributes in order to preserve the information. Note, the SQS messages cannot be as big as Kinesis messages. The limit is 256kB per message, but we send the messages as Base64 encoded, so the limit goes down to 192kB for the original message.

#### Setting up the SQS queues

(This section only applies to the case when SQS is used as a fallback sink when Kinesis is unavailable. If you are using SQS as the primary sink, then the settings below should be ignored and the `good` and `bad` streams should be configured as normal under `streams.good` and `streams.bad` respectively.)

To start using this feature, you will first need to set up the SQS queues. Two separate queues are required for good (raw) events and bad events. The Collector then needs to be informed about the queue names, and this can be done by adding these as entries to `config.hocon:`

```properties
sqsGoodBuffer = {good-sqs-queue-url}
sqsBadBuffer = {bad-sqs-queue-url}
```
