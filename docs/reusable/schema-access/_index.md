Your schemas must be accessible to your pipeline to allow this validation. We provide [Iglu](/docs/pipeline-components-and-applications/iglu/index.md) for schema management.
* Within Snowplow BDP, you can [manage your schemas through your console](/docs/understanding-tracking-design/managing-data-structures/index.md).
* For Snowplow Open Source, see [igluctl](/docs/pipeline-components-and-applications/iglu/igluctl-2/index.md).
* If you are using Snowplow Micro for testing or debugging, [this guide](/docs/getting-started-with-micro/adding-schemas/index.md) explains how to configure custom schemas.
