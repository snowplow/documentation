Data structures, also called schemas, are explained here in [their Fundamentals page](/docs/fundamentals/schemas/index.md).

The pages in this section walk you through how to create, manage, and update data structures. Snowplow provides different options for data structure management:
* Snowplow BDP Console UI
* Data structures API
* [Snowplow CLI](/docs/data-product-studio/snowplow-cli/index.md)
* For Community users: [Iglu](/docs/api-reference/iglu/iglu-repositories/iglu-server/)
