Each section of the tutorial should have its own page:
    * Title in imperative case
    * Start with 1-2 paragraphs explaining the goal of the section
    * Include links to the relevant docs pages where possible
    * Link to the source code where relevant

## First step

One section page can have multiple steps, separated by headings.

## Second step

For each step:
    * Explain what the purpose is
    * Provide instructions of how to do it
    * Use code blocks and screenshots where appropriate
    * For code they need to run, include instructions on where to run it
    * State the expected outcome

## Troubleshooting

If you know of any issues that users are likely to encounter while following the section, include them here.
