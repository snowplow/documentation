Data applications are tools that help customers extract value from their data quickly by providing templated use-cases for data collection, modeling, and activation. They aim to reduce the technical barrier, making data analysis more accessible beyond just SQL users. These apps allow data teams to deliver new solutions to business stakeholders more efficiently, reducing time to value for your business. 

Data apps can be installed via requests made in Console, they are deployed into your cloud, are authenticated against your Console account, and connect directly to your destinations to query your Snowplow data. Permissions can be managed in the [usual way](/docs/using-the-snowplow-console/managing-users/managing-permissions/index.md).

## General Usage
### Help
<Icon icon="fa-regular fa-circle-question"/> Our apps provide useful help text throughout the apps, keep an eye out for the help icon to provide more context or help in using some functionality.

### Log Out
If you wish to Log out of the application, you can do this on the `Account` page of any application. Note this also logs you out of Console.

### Setup
Where the app has some requirements it will also have a `Setup` page that will validate what is available to the app, and provide information for steps to take for any unfulfilled requirements.
