By default, Signals calculates attributes in real time, in stream. Stream attributes are ideal for real-time use cases such as tracking the latest video a user played, or the number of page views in a session.

Use the Python SDK to define the attributes you want to calculate, as well as the entities that the attributes relate to. Group them together into a view, and apply this configuration to Signals.

All configuration is defined using the [Signals Python SDK](https://github.com/snowplow-incubator/snowplow-signals-sdk), or manually via the Signals API.

## Setting up your project

First, choose where to store your Signals configurations. We recommend creating a new repository.

The easiest way to use the Python SDK is within a Jupyter notebook. TODO link to example notebook for them to copy - does the SDK come with one?

Within your notebook, install the SDK.

```bash
pip install snowplow-signals
```

Once installed, you can start to define your configuration components. To test or apply your configuration, or retrieve calculated attributes from the Profiles Store, you'll need to connect to your Signals deployment.

## Connecting to Signals

To connect to Signals, you will need 4 values:

| Value           | Description                             | Where to get it                 | Format                            |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Signals API URL | The API URL for your Signals deployment | Provided by Snowplow            | `https://{{UUID}}.svc.snplow.net` |
| API key         | A Snowplow API key                      | Generated by you in BDP Console | UUID                              |
| API key ID      | A Snowplow API key ID                   | Generated by you in BDP Console | UUID                              |
| Organization ID | Your Snowplow organization ID           | Part of your BDP Console URL    | UUID                              |

This image shows how to find your organization ID:

Follow the instructions in [Account management](/docs/account-management/index.md) to generate your API key and key ID.

Add these four tokens to your environment or notebook secrets.

Create a `Signals` object by passing in the required values. This example shows how to access notebook secrets, assuming you gave them these names:

```python
from snowplow_signals import Signals

sp_signals = Signals(
    api_url=userdata.get('SP_API_URL'),
    api_key=userdata.get('SP_API_KEY'),
    api_key_id=userdata.get('SP_API_KEY_ID'),
    org_id=userdata.get('SP_ORG_ID'),
)
```

### Available methods

The created `Signals` object has the following methods:

| Method                  | Description                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `apply`                 | Registers the provided objects with Signals            |
| `test`                  | Tests a view against the atomic events table           |
| `get_view`              | Retrieves a view from the Profiles Store               |
| `get_online_attributes` | Retrieves specified attributes from the Profiles Store |

Read more about retrieving calculated attributes in [Retrieving values](/docs/signals/retrieval/index.md)

## Signals API

The Signals API allows you to manually configure and retrieve attributes and interventions. To access the full Swagger API documentation for your Signals deployment, use your Signals API URL followed by `/docs/`:

```bash
{{API_URL}}/docs/
```
