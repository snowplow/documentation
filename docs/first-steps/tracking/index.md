import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

Once your pipeline is set up, you will want to send some events to it. Here’s an overview of the different options.

:::note Limits

Keep in mind that some of our offerings have limits on the number of events you can send:
* For Try Snowplow, there is cap of 50 events per second. Any events above this cap will be dropped
* For Open Source, the default setup is sized for around 100 events per second

## Using the JavaScript tracker

The [JavaScript tracker](/docs/collecting-data/collecting-from-own-applications/javascript-trackers/javascript-tracker/web-quick-start-guide/index.md) is our most commonly used tracker. It’s a good choice for websites, and the installation process is similar to other tools like Google Analytics.

To use the JavaScript tracker on your site, you will need to obtain a code snippet first.

<Tabs groupId="offering" queryString>
  <TabItem value="enterprise" label="BDP Enterprise" default>

BDP Enterprise can automatically generate the snippet for you. Go to the [tag generator](https://console.snowplowanalytics.com/tag-generator) screen, fill in the necessary parameters, and copy the snippet at the bottom.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cloud" label="BDP Cloud">

You can find the pre-generated snippet in the [Getting started](https://console.snowplowanalytics.com/environments/start-tracking-events?fromDocs) section.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="try" label="Try Snowplow">

You can find the pre-generated snippet in the [Console](https://try.snowplowanalytics.com/).

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="opensource" label="Open Source">

Take note of the Collector URL you’ve chosen when deploying your Open Source pipeline.

:::note

If you have not yet configured an SSL certificate and a custom domain name for your Collector, you can use `http://<collector_dns_name>` (`http`, not `https`), where `collector_dns_name` is the output of the pipeline Terraform module.

Then, follow the JavaScript tracker [quick start guide](/docs/collecting-data/collecting-from-own-applications/javascript-trackers/javascript-tracker/web-quick-start-guide/index.md) to create your snippet.
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once you have the snippet, there are two common ways to deploy it.

<Tabs groupId="snippet-deployment" queryString>
  <TabItem value="direct" label="Editing your website directly" default>

If you have access to the source code of your site, paste the snippet into the `<head>` HTML section and deploy the changes.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="gtm" label="Using Google Tag Manager">

If you are already using Google Tag Manager to add various code snippets to your site, you can add your Snowplow snippet there.

- Navigate to the Google Tag Manager account you wish to add tracking to
- Create a new Custom HTML tag and paste the Javascript snippet into the tag
- Set it to fire on 'All Pages' or a trigger of your choosing
- You can preview your tag to send some events before publishing it


  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The JavaScript tracker captures many events (e.g. page views) automatically, so you should start accumulating your first events as soon as the changes are rolled out to your users.

## Using other trackers

We have many different trackers in different programming languages, in case the JavaScript tracker is not a fit for you. For example, see the [mobile native trackers](/docs/collecting-data/collecting-from-own-applications/mobile-trackers/index.md) or the [full list](/docs/collecting-data/collecting-from-own-applications/index.md) of what’s available.

:::tip

For quick testing, you might be tempted to send data to your Collector URL using a basic command-line tool like `cURL`. However, you would need to ensure that the data format follows our [tracker protocol](/docs/collecting-data/collecting-from-own-applications/snowplow-tracker-protocol/index.md). Instead, take a look at the [command-line tracker](/docs/collecting-data/collecting-from-own-applications/snowplow-tracking-cli/index.md) that will do this for you.
