Snowplow CLI brings data management elements of Snowplow Console into the command line. It allows you to download your data structures and data products to YAML/JSON files and publish them back to Console. This enables git-ops-like workflows, with reviews and branching.

## Install

Snowplow CLI can be installed with [homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
```
brew install snowplow/taps/snowplow-cli
```

Verify the installation with
```
snowplow-cli --help
```

For systems where homebrew is not available binaries for multiple platforms can be found in [releases](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-cli/releases).

Example installation for `linux_x86_64` using `curl`

```bash
curl -L -o snowplow-cli https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-cli/releases/latest/download/snowplow-cli_linux_x86_64
chmod u+x snowplow-cli
```

Verify the installation with
```
./snowplow-cli --help
```

## Configure

### Automated Setup

The easiest way to configure Snowplow CLI is using the built-in `setup` command:

```bash
snowplow-cli setup
```

This command will:
- Guide you through device authentication with Snowplow Console
- Automatically create and configure your API credentials
- Set up your organization ID

**Prerequisites:** Your Snowplow Console account must have sufficient permissions to create API keys.

You can also use optional flags:
- `--read-only`: Create a read-only API key
- `--dotenv`: Store configuration as .env file in current working directory

### Manual Configuration

If you prefer manual configuration, you will need these values:

* An API Key ID and the corresponding API Key (secret), which are generated from the [credentials section](https://console.snowplowanalytics.com/credentials) in Console.
* Your Organization ID, which you can find [on the _Manage organization_ page](https://console.snowplowanalytics.com/settings) in Console.

Snowplow CLI can take its configuration from a variety of sources. More details are available from `./snowplow-cli data-structures --help`. Variations on these three examples should serve most cases.

<Tabs groupId="config">
  <TabItem value="env" label="env variables or .dotenv file" default>

  ```bash
  SNOWPLOW_CONSOLE_API_KEY_ID=********-****-****-****-************
  SNOWPLOW_CONSOLE_API_KEY=********-****-****-****-************
  SNOWPLOW_CONSOLE_ORG_ID=********-****-****-****-************
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="defaultconfig" label="$HOME/.config/snowplow/snowplow.yml" >

  ```yaml
  console:
    api-key-id: ********-****-****-****-************
    api-key: ********-****-****-****-************
    org-id: ********-****-****-****-************
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="args" label="inline arguments" >

  ```bash
  ./snowplow-cli data-structures --api-key-id ********-****-****-****-************ --api-key ********-****-****-****-************ --org-id ********-****-****-****-************
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Snowplow CLI defaults to yaml format. It can be changed to json by either providing a `--output-format json` flag or setting the `output-format: json` config value. It will work for all commands where it matters, not only for `generate`.

### Verify Configuration

After configuration, you can verify that everything is working correctly using the `status` command:

```bash
snowplow-cli status
```

This command will:
- Check that your API credentials are properly configured
- Verify connectivity to Snowplow Console
- Confirm your organization access
- Provide helpful troubleshooting information if issues are found

If the status check fails, the command will suggest the next steps such as running `snowplow-cli setup` to reconfigure your credentials.

### Configure YAML language server (optional)

During the data products authoring process it's convenient to have the editor highlight errors, suggest possible values, and show examples.
All files generated by Snowplow CLI's `generate` and `download` commands will contain a special comment as part of the file. This comment can be interpreted by a YAML Language server.

For VS Code you can get this authoring functionality using this [YAML extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml). Instructions for other editors can be found [here](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server?tab=readme-ov-file#clients).

After that running `snowplow-cli ds generate test` and opening the generated file in the configured editor of choice should look something like the following:

## MCP server

The Snowplow CLI includes a local Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables natural language interaction with AI assistants like Claude Desktop, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and other MCP-compatible clients for creating, validating, and managing your Snowplow tracking plans. This allows you to:

- Create and validate data structures through conversation
- Analyze tracking requirements and suggest implementations
- Validate data products and source applications

For setup instructions and configuration examples for different MCP clients, see our [MCP tutorial](/tutorials/snowplow-cli-mcp/introduction).
