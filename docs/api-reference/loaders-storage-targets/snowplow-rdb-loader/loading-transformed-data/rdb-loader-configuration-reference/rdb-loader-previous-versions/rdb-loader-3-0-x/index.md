An example of the minimal required config for the Redshift loader can be found [here](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-rdb-loader/blob/master/config/redshift.config.minimal.hocon) and a more detailed one [here](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-rdb-loader/blob/master/config/redshift.config.reference.hocon).

An example of the minimal required config for the Snowflake loader can be found [here](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-rdb-loader/blob/master/config/snowflake.config.minimal.hocon) and a more detailed one [here](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-rdb-loader/blob/master/config/snowflake.config.reference.hocon).

Both applications use a common module for core functionality, so only the `storage` sections are different in their config.

This is a complete list of the options that can be configured:

## Redshift Loader `storage` section

Periodic schedules to stop loading, eg for Redshift maintenance window.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `schedules.noOperation.[*]`          | Required if `schedules` section is configured. Array of objects which specifies no-operation windows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| `retryQueue.*`                       | Optional. Additional backlog of recently failed folders that could be automatically retried. Retry queue saves a failed folder and then re-reads the info from `shredding_complete` S3 file. (Despite the legacy name of the message, which is required for backward compatibility, this also works with wide row format data.)                                                                           |

How often batch of failed folders should be pulled into a discovery queue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `retryQueue.size`                    | Required if `retryQueue` section is configured. How many failures should be kept in memory. After the limit is reached new failures are dropped.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `retryQueue.maxAttempts`             | Required if `retryQueue` section is configured. How many attempts to make for each folder. After the limit is reached new failures are dropped.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `retryQueue.interval`                | Required if `retryQueue` section is configured. Artificial pause after each failed folder being added to the queue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `retries.*`                          | Optional. Unlike `retryQueue` these retries happen immediately, without proceeding to another message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Starting backoff period, eg '30 seconds'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `retries.strategy`                   | The only possible value is `EXPONENTIAL`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `retries.attempts`                   | Optional. How many attempts to make before sending the message into retry queue. If missing, `cumulativeBound` will be used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `retries.cumulativeBound`            | Optional. When backoff reaches this delay, eg '1 hour', the loader will stop retrying. If both this and `attempts` are not set, the loader will retry indefinitely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `timeouts.loading`                   | Optional. How long, eg '1 hour', `COPY` statement execution can take before considering Redshift unhealthy. If no progress (ie, moving to a different subfolder) within this period, the loader will abort the transaction.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `timeouts.nonLoading`                | Optional. How long, eg '10 mins', non-loading steps such as `ALTER TABLE` can take before considering Redshift unhealthy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `timeouts.sqsVisibility`             | Optional. The time window in which a message must be acknowledged. Otherwise it is considered abandoned. If a message has been pulled, but hasn't been acked, the time before it is again available to consumers is equal to this, eg '5 mins'. Another consequence is that if the loader has failed on processing a message, the next time it will get this (or anything) from the queue has this delay. |
