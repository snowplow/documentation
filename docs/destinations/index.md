Read more about Snowplow data destinations [here](/docs/fundamentals/destinations/index.md).

[Data warehouses and data lakes](/docs/destinations/warehouses-lakes/index.md) are primary destinations for Snowplow data.

Snowplow also supports many ways to [forward events](/docs/destinations/forwarding-events/index.md) to a variety of platforms. Snowplow has native integrations as well as supporting Snowplow, vendor and community authored destinations via Google Tag Manager Server Side.

Finally, [reverse ETL](/docs/destinations/reverse-etl/index.md) enables you to publish data from your warehouse directly to marketing platforms, where it can be activated.
