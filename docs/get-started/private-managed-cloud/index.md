To get started with Snowplow Customer Data Infrastructure, follow the **Getting Started** steps in [Snowplow Console](https://console.snowplowanalytics.com/getting-started). You will receive an account as part of your onboarding.

## CDI Cloud

If you have a Snowplow [CDI Cloud](/docs/get-started/index.md#cdi-cloud) account, we'll set up your infrastructure for you. Check out **Pipelines** in Console to see your new pipeline.

## CDI Private Managed Cloud

If you have a Snowplow [CDI Private Managed Cloud](/docs/get-started/index.md#cdi-private-managed-cloud) account, the Getting Started steps will guide you through setting up your cloud environment. You can also find the instructions here:
* [AWS Setup Guide](/docs/get-started/private-managed-cloud/setup-guide-aws/index.md)
* [Azure Setup Guide](/docs/get-started/private-managed-cloud/setup-guide-azure/index.md)
* [GCP Setup Guide](/docs/get-started/private-managed-cloud/setup-guide-gcp/index.md)

Once you've set up your cloud environment, go to **Pipelines** in Console to request your new pipeline.
