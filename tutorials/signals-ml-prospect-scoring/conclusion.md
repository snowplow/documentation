<!--
In this tutorial you've learned how to use Signals to calculate and serve information about user behavior in near real time.

This is the process workflow:
* Define attributes
* Test definitions
* Apply attribute configurations to Signals
* Retrieve calculated attribute values from the Profiles Store

## Next steps

Here are some ideas for further exploration:
* Try out other entities, e.g. `domain_userid`, to calculate the attributes against
* Define attributes based off other event types
* Retrieve calculated attributes in your real applications
* Explore our other Signals tutorials -->
