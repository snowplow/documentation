[Snowtype](/docs/data-product-studio/snowtype/index.md) is a Snowplow BDP tool that generates JavaScript classes from self-describing event schemas. It can be used with Google Tag Manager to assist with implementing custom tracking faster and in a less error-prone way. Follow [this guide](/docs/data-product-studio/snowtype/working-with-gtm/index.md) to get set up.
