# Snowplow Normalize Package
:::note

Normalize in this context means [database normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization), as these models produce flatter data, not statistical normalization.
:::

**The package source code can be found in the [snowplow/dbt-snowplow-normalize repo](https://github.com/snowplow/dbt-snowplow-normalize ), and the docs for the [macro design are here](https://snowplow.github.io/dbt-snowplow-normalize/#/overview/snowplow_normalize ).** 

The package provides [macros](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/jinja-macros) and a python script that is used to generate your normalized events, filtered events, and users table for use within downstream ETL tools such as Hightouch. See the [Model Design](#model-design) section for further details on these tables.

The package only includes the base incremental scratch model and does not have any derived models, instead it generates models in your project as if they were custom models you had built on top of the [Snowplow incremental tables](/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-advanced-usage/dbt-incremental-logic/index.md), using the `_this_run` table as the base for new events to process each run. See the [configuration](/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-configuration/index.md) section for the variables that apply to the incremental model.

:::note
The incremental model is simplified compared to the standard web model, this package does not use sessions to identify which historic events to reprocess and just uses the `collector_tstamp` and package variables to identify which events to (re)process.

## Model Design

</p>

The package outputs models for 3 types of models: normalized events, a filtered events model, and a users model (different to the users table generated by the `web` or `mobile` packages).

### Normalized Event Models
For each `event_names` listed, a model is generated for records with matching event type(s) and with the specified columns from the `atomic.events` table, including flattened (1 level) versions of your [self-describing event](/docs/understanding-tracking-design/out-of-the-box-vs-custom-events-and-entities/index.md#self-describing-events) or [context](/docs/understanding-tracking-design/predefined-vs-custom-entities/index.md#custom-contexts) columns. The table names are versioned based on the same versioning that is used to handle schema evolution with your data warehouse tables (see [Updating Your Models](#updating-your-models) section for potential issues with evolving schemas). In the case of multiple event types for a table you will need to provide the name and version of the table yourself. These can be combined into other models you create, or be used directly in downstream tools. The model file itself consists of lists of variables and a macro call.

For example, if you have 3 `event_names` listed as `['page_view']`, `['page_ping']`, and `['link_click', 'deep_link_click']` then 3 models will be generated, each containing only those respective events from the atomic events table.

### Filtered Events Model
A single model is built that provides `event_id`, `collector_tstamp` and the name of the Normalized Event Model that the event was processed into, it does not include records for events that were not of an event type in your configuration. The model file itself is a series of `UNION` statements.

### Users Model
The users model provides a more traditional view of a Users table than that presented in the other Snowplow dbt packages. This model has one row per non-null `user_id` (or other identifier column you specify), and takes the latest (based on `collector_tstamp`) values from the specified contexts to ensure you always have the latest version of the information that you choose to collect about your users. This is designed to be immediately usable in downstream tools. The model file itself consists of lists of variables and a macro call.

## Package Overview

This package consists of two macros, a python script, and some example configuration files to help you get started, as well as the incremental models to build these normalized tables from:

  - `normalize_events` _(macro)_: This macro does the heavy lifting of the package, taking a series of inputs to generate the SQL required to normalize the `atomic.events` table and flatten any [self-describing event](/docs/understanding-tracking-design/out-of-the-box-vs-custom-events-and-entities/index.md#self-describing-events) or [context](/docs/understanding-tracking-design/predefined-vs-custom-entities/index.md#custom-contexts) columns. While you can use this macro manually it is recommended to create the models that use it by using the script provided.

  - `users_table` _(macro)_: This macro takes a series of inputs to generate the SQL that will produce your users table, using the user identifier column you define, and any custom contexts from your events table. The identifier will be always be renamed to `user_id` in the output.

  - `snowplow_normalize_model_gen.py` _(script)_: This script uses an input configuration to generate the models based on a provided configuration file. See the [operation](#operation) section for more information.

    ```yml title="snowplow_normalize_model_gen.py help"
    usage: snowplow_normalize_model_gen.py [-h] [--version] [-v] [--dryRun] [--configHelp] [--cleanUp] config

    Produce dbt model files for normalizing your Snowplow events table into 1 table per event type.

    positional arguments:
    config         relative path to your configuration file

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help     show this help message and exit
    --version      show program's version number and exit
    -v, --verbose  verbose flag for the running of the tool
    --dryRun       flag for a dry run (does not write/delete any files)
    --configHelp   prints information relating to the structure of the config file
    --cleanUp      delete any models not present in your config and exit (no models will be generated)
    ```

  - `example_normalize_config.json`: This file is an example of an input to the python script, showing all options and valid values. For additional information about the file structure run `python dbt_packages/snowplow_normalize/utils/snowplow_normalize_model_gen.py --configHelp` in your project root.

  - `example_resolver_config.json`: This file is an example [Iglu Resolver](/docs/pipeline-components-and-applications/iglu/iglu-resolver/index.md) configuration. It supports custom iglu servers with API keys, but does not currently support accessing embedded registries. For more information please see the Resolver docs.

  - `models/base/`: Models relating to the incremental nature of the package, processing only new events (and those covered by the lookback window). 
## Operation

:::tip Using dbt Cloud?

If you are using dbt Cloud then you will need to run the model-generating script locally, as there is no way to do this in cloud, and then copy your models up to your Cloud environment. You'll still need to add the package to your `packages.yml` file in your project.

You will need to have [python installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/), and basic experience using the terminal and a text editor, but there is no need to install dbt. If you clone or download the [package repo](https://github.com/snowplow/dbt-snowplow-normalize) you can follow the instruction below, but remove the `dbt_packages/snowplow_normalize` from the front of paths when you see it.

:::

In general, it should only be required to run the script in this package once to begin with, then only as/when you need to add new models based on new events or alter the contexts attached to existing ones. While it is possible to manually set the values and use the macros, it is not recommended due to the time it would take and the likelihood of making mistakes.


The script should always be run from the **root** of your dbt project (the same level your `dbt_project.yml` file is at).

### Install python packages
:::caution
Python [>=3.7, <=3.10] is currently supported

:::

The script only requires 2 additional packages (`jsonschema` and `requests`) that are not built into python by default, you can install these by running the below command, or by installing them by your preferred method.

```bash
pip install -r dbt_packages/snowplow_normalize/utils/requirements.txt
```

### Configuration File
:::caution

There may be changes to the config file between versions, this page will always contain the latest information but if you are using an older version you should call the python script with the `--configHelp` flag.

:::

The configuration file is used to provide the information needed to generate the SQL models listed above. We use the [schemas](/docs/understanding-tracking-design/understanding-schemas-and-validation/index.md) that are defined in your event tracking to ensure full alignment with the data and reduce the amount of information you need to provide.

:::info
The config file is a JSON file which can be viewed by running the python script with the `--configHelp` flag. The config file can be located anywhere in your project, but it must have the following structure. Note that you must provide **at least** one of `event_columns`, `self_describing_event_schemas` or `context_schemas` for each event listed.

An example configuration can be found in the `utils/example_normalize_config.json` file within the package.

For [Snowplow BDP](/docs/getting-started-with-snowplow-bdp/enterprise/index.md) customers you can use the [Tracking Catalogue](/docs/discovering-data/tracking-catalog/index.md) to discover which events you are tracking and the contexts enabled for each event, however you will still need to get the schema urls from your Data Structures.

:::tip
You should keep your configuration file, and your resolver file if you have one, at your project level and not inside the the snowplow-normalize package to avoid them being overwritten/deleted when the package is updated.

:::

### Producing your models
To produce your models you need to run 

`python dbt_packages/snowplow_normalize/utils/snowplow_normalize_model_gen.py path/to/your/config.json` 

(or equivalent path in Windows) from the root of your dbt project. This will produce one `.sql` file for each of the event name specified in the `events` part of your configuration, one `.sql` file for the combined filtered events table if a name was provided, and one `.sql` file for your users table if schema(s) were provided. These files will be in your `models` folder in the sub-folder specified in your config. 

:::info
Custom error messages have been added to the script to try and catch any issues and provide suggested resolutions to any issues such as invalid configurations or failing validation of schemas. If you persist in getting errors when validating schemas you believe you be correct, you can disable this validation by setting `validate_schemas` to `false` in your config. 
:::

### Adding new models
To add new models for new types of events, simply add them to your config and run the model again. Note that `overwrite` must be set to `true` for your filtered events table model to include these new events, and that this will overwrite any manual changes you made to the other models generated by this script.

### Updating your models
If you wish to update your models, such as adding a new context, removing a column, or updating to a new schema version, you must update your config file and run the script again, ensuring the `overwrite` value is set to `true`. This will remove any custom changes you made to the model file itself and you will need to re-add these.

All events models will be updated including the filtered events table, it is not possible at this time to update just a subset of models.

:::warning
Adding or removing columns from your dbt model, either manually or by changes caused by a different schema version, without specifying the `on_schema_change` model configuration or directly altering the tables in your database, is very likely to result in unintended outcomes - either your new columns will not appear or dbt may return an error. Please see the [dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-models#what-if-the-columns-of-my-incremental-model-change) for what to do in this situation. If you need to backfill new columns regardless you can perform a rerun of the entire model following the instructions [here](/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-custom-models/index.md#tearing-down-and-restarting-a-subset-of-models) *(note using the `--full-refresh` flag will not work in this case due to the use of the Snowplow incremental logic)*.
:::

#### Removing specific columns
If you want to not select all columns from your self describing event or context then you can manually delete them from the lists in each model file, ensuring to delete the matching record in the `*_types` list as well. The same warning applies from [Updating your models](#updating-your-models), and any overwriting run of the script will remove these changes.

### Removing models
You can remove all models that don't exist in your config by running the script with the `--cleanUp` flag. This will scan the `models_folder` folder provided in your config and list all models in this folder that don't match those listed in your config file; you will then be asked to confirm deletion of these. If you may wish to re-enable these models at a later date you can [disable them in your project](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/enabled) instead.

:::caution
If you have other models in the same sub-folder that were not generated via this package then this will attempt to delete those files.
