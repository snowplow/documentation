## Snowplow Inspector

If you are implementing tracking on a website or in a web or mobile application, we highly recommend to install the [Snowplow Inspector](/docs/testing-debugging/snowplow-inspector/index.md). It will help you validate which Snowplow events are triggering, look at their properties, and more.

## Snowplow Micro

For debugging [enrichments](/docs/enriching-your-data/index.md), streaming applications (e.g. using the [analytics SDKs](/docs/modeling-your-data/analytics-sdk/index.md)), and other more advanced usage, take a look at [Snowplow Micro](/docs/testing-debugging/snowplow-micro/index.md). Itâ€™s a minified Snowplow pipeline that can run on your machine.
