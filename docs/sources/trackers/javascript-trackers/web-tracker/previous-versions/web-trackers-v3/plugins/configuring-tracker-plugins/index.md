The Snowplow JavaScript Trackers v3 allow extension via plugins. There are a number of official Snowplow plugins, but we also encourage building your own.

The plugin configuration is different between the Javascript (tag) and browser (npm package) versions of the Snowplow web tracker.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```
