The package provides a single method to initialize and configure a new tracker, the `Snowplow.createTracker` method. It accepts configuration parameters for the tracker and returns a `SnowplowTracker` instance.

```dart
SnowplowTracker tracker = await Snowplow.createTracker(
    namespace: 'ns1',
    endpoint: 'http://...',
    trackerConfig: const TrackerConfiguration(...),
    gdprConfig: const GdprConfiguration(...),
    subjectConfig: const SubjectConfiguration(...));
);
```

The method returns a `SnowplowTracker` instance. This can be later used for tracking events, or accessing tracker properties. However, all methods provided by the `SnowplowTracker` instance are also available as static functions in the `Snowplow` class but they require passing the tracker namespace as string.

The only required attributes of the `Snowplow.createTracker` method are `namespace` used to identify the tracker, and the Snowplow collector `endpoint`. Additionally, one can configure the HTTP method to be used when sending events to the collector, as well as a custom POST path, and provide configuration by instantiating classes for `TrackerConfiguration`, `SubjectConfiguration`, or `GdprConfiguration`. By default, events are sent by POST. The following arguments are accepted by the `Snowplow.createTracker` method:

| Attribute        | Type                    | Description                                                                          |
|------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `namespace`      | `String`                | Tracker namespace to identify the tracker.                                           |
| `endpoint`       | `String`                | URI for the Snowplow collector endpoint.                                             |
| `method`         | `Method?`               | HTTP method to use: `Method.get` or `Method.post` (`Method.post` is default).        |
| `customPostPath` | `String?`               | Custom POST path.                                                                    |
| `requestHeaders` | `Map<String, String>?` | Map of custom HTTP headers to add to requests to the collector. |
| `trackerConfig`  | `TrackerConfiguration?` | Configuration of the tracker and the core tracker properties.                        |
| `gdprConfig`     | `GdprConfiguration?`    | Determines the GDPR context that will be attached to all events sent by the tracker. |
| `subjectConfig`  | `SubjectConfiguration?` | Subject information about tracked user and device that is added to events.           |
| `emitterConfig` | `EmitterConfiguration?` | Configuration for how the events are sent.           |

:::note
The ability to set `customPostPath` was added in v0.2.0. Setting a custom POST path can be useful in avoiding adblockers; it replaces the default "com.snowplowanalytics/snowplow/tp2". Your event collector must also be configured to accept the custom path.

The `EmitterConfiguration` class was added in v0.3.0.

## Configuration of tracker properties: `TrackerConfiguration`

`TrackerConfiguration` provides options to configure properties and features of the tracker. In addition to setting the app identifier and device platform, the configuration enables turning several automatic context entities on and off.

:::

The optional `WebActivityTracking` property configures page tracking on Web. Initializing the configuration will inform `SnowplowObserver` observers (see section on auto-tracking in "Tracking events") to auto track `PageViewEvent` events instead of `ScreenView` events on navigation changes. Further, setting the `minimumVisitLength` and `heartbeatDelay` properties of the `WebActivityTracking` instance will enable activity tracking using 'page ping' events on Web.

Activity tracking monitors whether a user continues to engage with a page over time, and record how he / she digests content on the page over time. That is accomplished using 'page ping' events. If activity tracking is enabled, the web page is monitored to see if a user is engaging with it. (E.g. is the tab in focus, does the mouse move over the page, does the user scroll etc.) If any of these things occur in a set period of time (`minimumVisitLength` seconds from page load and every `heartbeatDelay` seconds after that), a page ping event fires, and records the maximum scroll left / right and up / down in the last ping period. If there is no activity in the page (e.g. because the user is on a different tab in his / her browser), no page ping fires.

See [this page](/docs/collecting-data/collecting-from-own-applications/flutter-tracker/anonymous-tracking/index.md) for information about anonymous tracking.
