Setting up permissions in IAM for the user(s) installing Snowplow is an 3 step process:

**Disclaimer: Snowplow Analytics Ltd will not be liable for any problems caused by the full or partial implementation of these instructions on your Amazon Web Services account. If in doubt, please consult an independent AWS security expert.**

## Setup the IAM group

### [](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Setup-IAM-permissions-for-users-installing-Snowplow#initial-group-configuration)Initial group configuration

- Find and click on the IAM icon on the AWS dashboard
- Click on the _Create a New Group of Users_ button
- Enter a _Group Name_ of `snowplow-setup`
- For Permissions select the _Custom policy_ option
- Give it a policy name such as `snowplow-policy-setup-infrastructure`

### Permissions configuration

Depending on what Pipeline needs to be setup you will need slightly varying permissions.

#### [](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Setup-IAM-permissions-for-users-installing-Snowplow#batch-permissions)Batch Permissions

The following permissions are needed for all batch proccessing operations:

- Amazon S3
- Amazon EMR
- Amazon EC2 (required for EmrEtlRunner)
- Amazon Marketplaces (required for EmrEtlRunner)
- Amazon CloudFront (required for Cloudfront collector)
- Amazon Elastic Beanstalk (required for Clojure collector)
- Amazon Elasticsearch service (for loading bad rows)
- Amazon Redshift (required for Redshift)
- Amazon Cloudformation (required if the Snowplow team setup your Snowplow data pipeline, as we use Cloudformation)
- Amazon IAM (required as part of the Clojure collector setup, as a role is created for the Clojure collector application)
- Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL server required by Iglu Server)

**If you are not using the Clojure Collector, you can remove the Elastic Beanstalk section.**

Paste the following JSON into the _Policy Document_ text area:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "acm:*",
        "autoscaling:*",
        "aws-marketplace:ViewSubscriptions",
        "aws-marketplace:Subscribe",
        "aws-marketplace:Unsubscribe",
        "cloudformation:*",

  ]
}
```

- Amazon DynamoDB (required for Kinesis Applications to work with Kinesis Streams)
- Amazon CloudWatch/Logs
- Amazon AutoScaling (required for all Kinesis Applications to work effectively)

  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",

Check that the configuration for your new IAM group looks something like this:

![](images/new-iam-group-review.png)

- Click _Continue_ and you should see confirmation that the User has been created.
- Click _Download Credentials_ to save these credentials locally.
- Click _Close Window_.

Provide these credentials in a secure way to whoever is setting up Snowplow for you, so that they can add them into the configuration of your EmrEtlRunner applications.

## Allow the IAM user to login

For much of the Snowplow setup process, the IAM user you have setup above will need access to the Amazon Web Services control panel.

- From within the _Users_ tab inside the IAM dashboard, click on your `snowplow` user
- Switch to the _Security Credentials_ tab in the bottom pane, and click _Manage Password_ on the right
- Select _Assign an auto-generated password_:
- Click _Apply_
- Click _Download Credentials_ to save these credentials locally.
- Click _Close Window_.

Now, provide the following details in a secure way to whoever is setting up Snowplow for you:

- Login URL: [https://snplow.signin.aws.amazon.com/console](https://snplow.signin.aws.amazon.com/console)
- Username: `snowplow`
- Password: _\[as downloaded\]_
