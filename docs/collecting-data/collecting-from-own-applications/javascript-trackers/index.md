The Snowplow JavaScript Trackers support being used in a number of environments.

There are currently three trackers:

- **Browser Tracker (v3)** for installation into web apps via npm. Popular when natively integrating tracking into React, Angular and Vue applications.
- **JavaScript Tracker (v2 and v3)** for loading via both synchronous and asynchronous tags, by adding code snippets to your website or Tag Manager solution.
- **Node.js Tracker (v3)** for use in server-side Node.js environments via npm.

<p>All three trackers can be found on <a href="https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-javascript-tracker">Github</a>. The current version is {versions.javaScriptTracker}.</p>
