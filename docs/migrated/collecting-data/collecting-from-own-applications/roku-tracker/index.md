The Snowplow Roku Tracker allows you to track Snowplow events in your BrightScript and BrighterScript applications. The tracker is compatible with SceneGraph channels.

The tracker is published on NPM as [@snowplow/roku-tracker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@snowplow/roku-tracker) and can be installed with [ropm](https://github.com/rokucommunity/ropm). It may also be included in BrightScript apps directly by copying source files from releases [published on Github](https://github.com/snowplow-incubator/snowplow-roku-tracker).

We've created a simple [demo Roku channel](/docs/migrated/collecting-data/collecting-from-own-applications/roku-tracker/example-app/) to show you the tracker in use.
