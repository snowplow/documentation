```mdx-code-block
import Badges from '@site/src/components/Badges';

<Badges badgeType="Actively Maintained"></Badges>
```

The JavaScript Tracker supports both synchronous and asynchronous tags. We recommend the asynchronous tags in nearly all instances, as these do not slow down page load times.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```
