# Setting up via Snowplow Console

Snowplow provides a fully managed service for running data models. We recommend this if you are just getting started out, or donâ€™t anticipate needing to build your own custom models. To get started, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Data models section of the Snowplow Console and click `Add data model`

2. Select `Unified Digital`

4. Edit your configuration variables, pay particular attention to web and mobile data, and the core enrichments e.g. IAB, YAUAA. This means they will be un-nested from the atomic columns and made available in the derived tables.
