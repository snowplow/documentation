The Snowplow Signals SDK allows you to define attributes, create views, and retrieve user features. It requires Python 3.12 or above.

Install the SDK using pip:

```bash
$ pip install snowplow-signals
```

To connect to your Signals deployment, you will need 4 values:

- API URL - This will be generated by Snowplow and shared with you
- API Key ID and the corresponding API Key (secret), which are generated from the [credentials section](https://console.snowplowanalytics.com/credentials) in BDP Console.
- The organization ID, which can be retrieved from the URL immediately following the .com when visiting BDP Console:
