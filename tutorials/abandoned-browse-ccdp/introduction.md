Abandoned browse is a common ecommerce problem where users show interest in products but don't complete a purchase. It is also referred to as "shopping cart abandonment," "abandoned basket," or "abandoned cart." Despite how common it is, it is still a challenge to implement a successful re-engagement campaign when using traditional marketing tools because they lack all the context needed to create a compelling personalized message. At Snowplow, we have found that a composable CDP approach is the best way to solve this problem. This tutorial has been written to show that it is straightforward to get started.

This tutorial demonstrates how to implement an abandoned browse tracking and re-engagement system using [Snowplow](https://snowplow.io/), [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/), and [Census](https://www.getcensus.com/). This solution helps ecommerce businesses identify and re-engage users who have shown interest in a product (e.g., viewed something for 10+ seconds) but haven't proceeded further.
