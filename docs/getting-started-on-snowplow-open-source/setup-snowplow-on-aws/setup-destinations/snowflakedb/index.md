[Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/) is a fully-managed cloud data warehouse with rich support of semi-structured data and tight integration with AWS. Snowplow allows to load data into Snowflake with [Snowplow Snowflake Loader](/docs/pipeline-components-and-applications/loaders-storage-targets/snowplow-snowflake-loader/index.md).

Before setting up Snowflake Loader it is recommeded to [get access to Snowflake](https://trial.snowflake.com/) database first. Setup is [a trivial command](/docs/pipeline-components-and-applications/loaders-storage-targets/snowplow-snowflake-loader/setup/index.md) in Snowflake Loader.
