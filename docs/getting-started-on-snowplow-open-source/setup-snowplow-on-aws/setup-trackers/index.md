Snowplow Trackers are SDKs that are integrated into applications to generate event-data and send that data to [Snowplow Collectors](/docs/getting-started-on-snowplow-open-source/setup-snowplow-on-aws/setup-the-snowplow-collector/index.md).

## 1. Choose and setup a Tracker

You can find [documentation for all of the available trackers](/docs/collecting-data/collecting-from-own-applications/index.md) in the Trackers section, or by selecting from the list below.

```mdx-code-block
import Block2936 from "@site/docs/reusable/untitled-reusable-block-38/_index.md"

<Block2936/>
```
