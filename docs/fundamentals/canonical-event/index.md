This page provides a reference for the standard fields that are found in all Snowplow events. These fields define the Snowplow tracker protocol, and are often called "atomic properties" or "atomic fields" in reference to the [Snowplow `atomic.events` table](/docs/fundamentals/warehouse-tables/index.md). They're also sometimes called "canonical fields".

Fields that are populated during tracking have two names associated with them:
* **Payload property**: a short payload name, to reduce the size of the HTTP request
* **Field name**: a more descriptive column or field name

The field **type** refers to the data type in the enriched event data. For some fields, the type is different for the raw tracker payload and the enriched event. Again, this is to reduce the size of the HTTP request.

Different event fields are populated by different applications, such as tracker SDKs or [enrichments](/docs/pipeline/enrichments/index.md). The **source** of data for each field is indicated in the tables below.

Atomic property values are validated during enrichment. If a required field is missing or invalid, for example the wrong type or length, the event will be processed as a [failed event](/docs/fundamentals/failed-events/index.md). The **reqd?** values in these tables specify whether a field is required for a Snowplow event.

Any payload that conforms to this protocol is a valid Snowplow event payload, whether it's sent by a Snowplow tracker SDK, a webhook, or a custom application. If you want to get into the details, check out these [example HTTP requests](/docs/events/http-requests/index.md). In total, the tracker protocol defines 131 fields, of which 89 are in use by Snowplow applications.

## Common fields

These fields are common to all Snowplow events, regardless of platform or event type.

### Event fields

The `event_id` is the unique identifier (UUID) for the table row. This should be generated by trackers, but if missing will be generated by the enrichment process.

### User fields

The `domain_userid` is regarded as the most reliable session based identifier for most use cases. It's treated as the primary `user_identifier` field in our data models that rely on sessionization, including the [Unified Digital](/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-models/dbt-unified-data-model/index.md) data model.

The `domain_sessionidx` is the number or index of the current user session. For example, an event occurring during a user's first session would have `domain_sessionidx` set to 1. The JavaScript tracker calculates this field by storing a visit count in a [first-party cookie](/docs/sources/web-trackers/cookies-and-local-storage/index.md).

The equivalent values on mobile are tracked in a [session entity](/docs/events/ootb-data/user-and-session-identification/index.md#client-session-context-entity).

The `network_userid` is set by a [Collector cookie](/docs/pipeline/collector/index.md) by default. You can override it by setting a `network_userid` with your tracker.

### Application fields

Use the application ID to distinguish events tracked from different applications or websites by the same Snowplow stack.

The platform ID is used to distinguish the same app running on different platforms, e.g. `iOS` vs `web`.

| Payload property | Field name     | Type | Description              | Reqd? | Example             | Source   | Web | Mobile |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ---- | ------------------------ | ----- | ------------------- | -------- | --- | ------ |
| `aid`            | `app_id`       | text | Application ID           | Yes   | `snow-game-android` | Tracking | ✅   | ✅      |
| `p`              | `platform`     | text | Platform the app runs on | Yes   | `web`               | Tracking | ✅   | ✅      |
| `tna`            | `name_tracker` | text | Tracker namespace        | No    | `tracker_1`         | Tracking | ✅   | ✅      |

This table shows the possible values for the `platform` field:

| Platform                  | `platform` value |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Web, including mobile web | `web`            |
| Mobile, tablet            | `mob`            |
| Desktop, laptop           | `pc`             |
| Server-side application   | `srv`            |
| General application       | `app`            |
| Connected TV              | `tv`             |
| Games console             | `cnsl`           |
| Internet of Things        | `iot`            |

:::info Tracker namespacing
The tracker namespace parameter is used to distinguish between different trackers. The name can be any string that doesn't contain a colon or semicolon character. Tracker namespacing allows you to run multiple trackers, pinging to different collectors.
:::

### Time and date fields

The `etl_tstamp` field records when the event was validated and enriched, not when it was loaded into the warehouse. The name is historical.

To set the `os_timezone` timezone field, use the [timezone plugin](/docs/sources/web-trackers/tracking-events/timezone-geolocation/index.md) on web trackers, or set the timezone in the [mobile tracker configuration](/docs/sources/mobile-trackers/client-side-properties/index.md).

| Payload property | Field name            | Type      | Description                                                 | Reqd? | Example                   | Source             | Web | Mobile |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------- | ------------------ | --- | ------ |
|                  | `collector_tstamp`    | timestamp | Timestamp for the event recorded by the Collector           | Yes   | `2013-11-26 00:02:05.123` | Pipeline           | ✅   | ✅      |
| `dtm`            | `dvce_created_tstamp` | timestamp | Timestamp for the event recorded on the client device       | No    | `2013-11-26 00:03:57.885` | Tracking           | ✅   | ✅      |
| `stm`            | `dvce_sent_tstamp`    | timestamp | Timestamp when event occurred, as recorded by client device | No    | `2013-11-26 00:03:58.032` | Tracking           | ✅   | ✅      |
|                  | `etl_tstamp`          | timestamp | Timestamp for when the event was validated and enriched     | No    | `2017-01-26 00:01:25.292` | Pipeline           | ✅   | ✅      |
|                  | `derived_tstamp`      | timestamp | Timestamp making allowance for inaccurate device clock      | No    | `2013-11-26 00:02:04.123` | Default enrichment | ✅   | ✅      |
| `ttm`            | `true_tstamp`         | timestamp | User-set "true timestamp" for the event                     | No    | `2013-11-26 00:02:04.123` | Tracking           | ✅   | ✅      |
|                  | `load_tstamp `        | timestamp | Timestamp for when the data was loaded into the warehouse   | No    | `2013-11-26 00:02:04.123` | Pipeline           | ✅   | ✅      |
| `tz`             | `os_timezone`         | text      | Client operating system timezone                            | No    | `Europe/London`           | Tracking           | ✅   | ✅      |

The trackers send timestamp properties as `int` in the payload, representing milliseconds since the Unix epoch, e.g. `1361553733313`. They're converted to `timestamp` type during enrichment. Similarly, the `tz` property is URL-encoded in the payload, e.g. `Europe%2FLondon`, and decoded during enrichment.

Read more about Snowplow timestamps [here](/docs/events/timestamps/index.md).

### Device and operating system fields

The `dvce_screenheight` and `dvce_screenwidth` screen resolution fields originate from a single `res` payload property. It's a string with the format `"<width>x<height>"`, e.g. `1900x1024`. During enrichment, this string is split into the two separate integer fields.

| Payload property | Field name          | Type | Description             | Reqd? | Example                                                                                | Source               | Web | Mobile |

### Marketing fields

These fields are populated by the [campaign attribution enrichment](/docs/pipeline/enrichments/available-enrichments/campaign-attribution-enrichment/index.md).

### Cross-domain tracking fields

The pipeline populates these fields by default if the event's `url` has a [cross-navigation querystring](/docs/events/cross-navigation/index.md).

| Payload property | Field name           | Type      | Description                                                   | Reqd? | Example               | Source             | Web | Mobile |

|                  | `refr_dvce_tstamp`   | timestamp | The time of attaching the `domain_userid` to the inbound link | No    | `2013-11-26 00:02:05` | Default enrichment | ✅   | ✅      |

### Snowplow versions fields

These fields record the versions of the various Snowplow components involved in processing the event.

| Payload property | Field name    | Type | Description              | Reqd? | Example                             | Source             | Web | Mobile |

## Web-specific fields

These fields apply only to events from web.

### Page fields

The `url`, `refr` and `page` payload properties are URL-encoded in the payload, e.g. `https%3A%2F%2Fwww.snowplow.io%2F` or `Snowplow%20Behavoral%20Data`, and decoded during enrichment.

The `url` property is further parsed during enrichment to populate the various `page_url*` fields. Similarly, the `refr` property is parsed to populate the various `refr_*` fields.

| Payload property | Field name         | Type | Description                                                            | Reqd? | Example                                                             | Source                                                                                                             | Web | Mobile |

### Document fields

The `doc_width` and `doc_height` page size fields originate from a single `ds` payload property. It's a string with the format `"<width>x<height>"`, e.g. `3000x1024`. During enrichment, this string is split into the two separate integer fields.

| Payload property | Field name    | Type | Description                   | Reqd? | Example | Source   | Web | Mobile |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ---- | ----------------------------- | ----- | ------- | -------- | --- | ------ |

| `ds`             | `doc_height`  | int  | The page's height in pixels   | No    | `3000`  | Tracking | ✅   | ❌      |

### Browser fields

The `br_viewwidth` and `br_viewheight` page size fields originate from a single `vp` payload property. It's a string with the format `"<width>x<height>"`, e.g. `1000x1000`. During enrichment, this string is split into the two separate integer fields.

| Payload property | Field name      | Type    | Description                              | Reqd? | Example | Source   | Web | Mobile |

| `vp`             | `br_viewwidth`  | int     | Viewport width                           | No    | `1000`  | Tracking | ✅   | ❌      |
| `vp`             | `br_viewheight` | int     | Viewport height                          | No    | `1000`  | Tracking | ✅   | ❌      |

## Baked-in event fields

[Baked-in event](/docs/fundamentals/events/index.md#baked-in-events) data is stored in specific default fields, rather than in self-describing event or entity columns.

There are no fields that are specific to page view events. All the relevant fields are included in the standard fields available for any web-based event e.g. `page_url`, or `page_title`.

### Page pings

Page ping events include four additional fields. They indicate how a user has scrolled over a web page since the last page ping:

| Payload property | Field name       | Type | Description                                        | Reqd? | Example |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------- |
| `pp_mix`         | `pp_xoffset_min` | int  | Minimum page x offset seen in the last ping period | No    | `10`    |
| `pp_max`         | `pp_xoffset_max` | int  | Maximum page x offset seen in the last ping period | No    | `100`   |
| `pp_miy`         | `pp_yoffset_min` | int  | Minimum page y offset seen in the last ping period | No    | `5`     |
| `pp_may`         | `pp_yoffset_max` | int  | Maximum page y offset seen in the last ping period | No    | `200`   |

### Structured events

Structured events use these fields to capture event data:

| Payload property | Field name    | Type    | Description                                                                                     | Reqd? | Example                       |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------- |
| `se_ca`          | `se_category` | text    | Category of event                                                                               | Yes * | `ecomm`, `video`              |
| `se_ac`          | `se_action`   | text    | Action performed, or event name                                                                 | Yes * | `add-to-basket`, `play-video` |
| `se_la`          | `se_label`    | text    | The object of the action e.g. the ID of the video played. or SKU of the product added to basket | No    | `pbz00123`                    |
| `se_pr`          | `se_property` | text    | A property associated with the object of the action                                             | No    | `HD`, `large`                 |
| `se_va`          | `se_value`    | decimal | A value associated with the event or action e.g. the value of goods added-to-basket             | No    | `9.99`                        |

\* These fields are only required for structured events.

## Self-describing event fields

For [self-describing events](/docs/fundamentals/events/index.md#self-describing-events), the pipeline extracts data from the event schema and populates the following fields:

| Field name      | Type | Description                           | Reqd? | Example      | Source             | Web | Mobile |
| --------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------- | ----- | ------------ | ------------------ | --- | ------ |
| `event_vendor`  | text | Business that defined the event       | Yes   | `com.acme`   | Default enrichment | ✅   | ✅      |
| `event_name`    | text | Event name                            | Yes   | `link_click` | Default enrichment | ✅   | ✅      |
| `event_format`  | text | Format for event; always `jsonschema` | Yes   | `jsonschema` | Default enrichment | ✅   | ✅      |
| `event_version` | text | Version of event schema               | Yes   | `1-0-2`      | Default enrichment | ✅   | ✅      |

:::note Extra columns for self-describing event data

Data in self-describing events or entities is added as additional columns, rather than in these standard atomic fields.

### Legacy ecommerce fields

There are a large number of fields in the tracker protocol specifically for [legacy ecommerce](/docs/fundamentals/events/index.md#baked-in-events) `transaction` and `transaction_item` events.

Fields that start `tr_` relate to the transaction as a whole. Fields that start `ti_` refer to the specific item included in the transaction, e.g. a product in the basket.

Single transactions typically span multiple lines of data: there will be a single line where `event` = `transaction`, where the `tr_` fields are set, and multiple lines (one for each product included) where `event` = `transaction_item` and the `ti_` fields are set.

| Field name           | Type    | Description                                                | Reqd? | Example         |
