# spEnrichedFilter

`spEnrichedFilter`: Specific to Snowplow data. Filters messages based on a regex match against an atomic field.

This transformation is for use on base-level atomic fields, rather than fields from contexts, or custom events â€” which can be achieved with `spEnrichedFilterContext` and `spEnrichedFilterUnstructEvent`.

Filters can be used in one of two ways, which is determined by the `filter_action` option. `filter_action` determines the behavior of the app when the regex provided evaluates to `true`. If it's set to `"keep"`, the app will complete the remaining transformations and send the message to the destination (unless a subsequent filter determines otherwise). If it's set to `"drop"`, the message will be acked and discarded, without continuing to the next transformation or target.

This example filters out all data whose `platform` value does not match either `web` or `mobile`.
