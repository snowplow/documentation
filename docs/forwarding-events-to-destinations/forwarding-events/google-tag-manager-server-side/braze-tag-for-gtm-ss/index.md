The Braze Tag for GTM SS allows events to be forwarded to [Braze](https://www.braze.com/). This Tag works best with the [Snowplow Client](/docs/forwarding-events-to-destinations/forwarding-events/google-tag-manager-server-side/snowplow-client-for-gtm-ss/index.md), but can also work with other GTM SS Clients such as GAv4.
