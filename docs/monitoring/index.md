[Failed events](/docs/fundamentals/failed-events/index.md) are events the pipeline had some problem processing (for example, events that did not pass validation).

We provide tooling for [monitoring](/docs/monitoring/monitoring-failed-events/index.md), [inspecting](/docs/monitoring/exploring-failed-events/index.md), and [recovering](/docs/monitoring/index.md) failed events.
