Snowplow trackers are client- or server-side libraries that enable you to collect events from your own applications.

All Snowplow trackers have open-source licenses (Apache 2.0 License, except for the JavaScript tracker which is BSD 3-Clause License). You can find the source code for each tracker on GitHub, where possible.

The JavaScript tracker repository is a multirepository containing the Web, Node.js, and React Native trackers.

For tracking events from third-party applications, use our [webhooks](/docs/sources/webhooks/index.md).
