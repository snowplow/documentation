```mdx-code-block
import Block2895 from "@site/docs/reusable/untitled-reusable-block-35/_index.md"

<Block2895/>
```

The JavaScript Tracker supports both synchronous and asynchronous tags. We recommend the asynchronous tags in nearly all instances, as these do not slow down page load times.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```
