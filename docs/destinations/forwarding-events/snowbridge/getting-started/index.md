```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import {versions} from '@site/src/componentVersions';
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import Telemetry from "@site/docs/reusable/telemetry/_index.md"
```

The fastest way to get started and experiment with Snowbridge is to run it via the command line:

1. Download the pre-compiled ZIP from the [releases](https://github.com/snowplow/snowbridge/releases/)
2. Unzip and run the binary with eg. `echo "hello world" | ./snowbridge`

The defaults for the app are stdin source, no transformations, and stdout target - so this should print the message 'hello world' along with some logging data to the console.

Next, the app can be configured using HCL - simply create a configuration file, and provide the path to it using the `SNOWBRIDGE_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.

You can find a guide to configuration in the [configuration section](/docs/destinations/forwarding-events/snowbridge/configuration/index.md).


```mdx-code-block
<Telemetry name="Snowbridge" since="1.0.0" idSetting="user_provided_id" disableSetting="disable_telemetry" />
```

## Distribution options

There are two distributions of Snowbridge.

<Tabs groupId="cloud" queryString>
  <TabItem value="default" label="Default" default>

The default distribution contains everything except for the [Kinesis source](/docs/destinations/forwarding-events/snowbridge/configuration/sources/kinesis.md), i.e. the ability to read from AWS Kinesis. This distribution is all licensed under the [Snowplow Limited Use License Agreement](/limited-use-license-1.0/). _(If you are uncertain how it applies to your use case, check our answers to [frequently asked questions](/docs/resources/limited-use-license-faq/index.md).)_

It’s available on Docker:

<CodeBlock language="bash">{
`docker pull snowplow/snowbridge:${versions.snowbridge}
docker run snowplow/snowbridge:${versions.snowbridge}`
}</CodeBlock>


  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="aws" label="AWS-specific (includes Kinesis source)" default>

The AWS-specific distribution contains everything, including the [Kinesis source](/docs/destinations/forwarding-events/snowbridge/configuration/sources/kinesis.md), i.e. the ability to read from AWS Kinesis. Like the default distribution, it’s licensed under the [Snowplow Limited Use License Agreement](/limited-use-license-1.0/) ([frequently asked questions](/docs/resources/limited-use-license-faq/index.md)). However, this distribution has a dependency on [twitchscience/kinsumer](https://github.com/twitchscience/kinsumer), which is licensed by Twitch under the [Amazon Software License](https://github.com/twitchscience/kinsumer/blob/master/LICENSE).

To comply with the [Amazon Software License](https://github.com/twitchscience/kinsumer/blob/master/LICENSE), you may only use this distribution of Snowbridge _“with the web services, computing platforms or applications provided by Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates, including Amazon Web Services, Inc.”_

It’s available on Docker:

<CodeBlock language="bash">{
`docker pull snowplow/snowbridge:${versions.snowbridge}-aws-only
docker run snowplow/snowbridge:${versions.snowbridge}-aws-only`
}</CodeBlock>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Deployment

The app can be deployed via services like EC2, ECS or Kubernetes using docker.

Configuration and authentication can be done by mounting the relevant files, and/or setting the relevant environment variables as per the standard authentication methods for cloud services.
