`enrich-kinesis` is a standalone JVM application that reads from and writes to Kinesis streams. It can be run from anywhere, as long as it has permissions to access the streams.

It is published on Docker Hub and can be run with the following command:

<CodeBlock language="bash">{
`docker run \\
  -it --rm \\
  -v $PWD:/snowplow \\
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxx \\
  -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxx \\
  snowplow/snowplow-enrich-kinesis:${versions.enrich} \\
  --enrichments /snowplow/enrichments \\
  --iglu-config /snowplow/resolver.json \\
  --config /snowplow/config.hocon
`}</CodeBlock>

Above assumes that you have following directory structure:

- `enrichments` directory, (possibly empty) with all [enrichment configuration JSONs](/docs/getting-started-on-snowplow-open-source/setup-snowplow-on-gcp/setup-validation-and-enrich/add-additional-enrichments/index.md)
- Iglu Resolver [configuration JSON](/docs/pipeline-components-and-applications/iglu/iglu-resolver/index.md)
- [configuration HOCON](/docs/pipeline-components-and-applications/enrichment-components/configuration-reference/index.md)

It is possible to use environment variables in all of the above (for Iglu and enrichments starting from `3.7.0` only).

Depending on where the app runs, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SECRET_KEY` might not be required.

Alternatively, you can download and runÂ [a jar file from the github release](https://github.com/snowplow/enrich/releases).

<CodeBlock language="bash">{
`java -jar snowplow-enrich-kinesis-${versions.enrich}.jar \\
  --enrichments /snowplow/enrichments \\
  --iglu-config /snowplow/resolver.json \\
  --config /snowplow/config.hocon
`}</CodeBlock>
