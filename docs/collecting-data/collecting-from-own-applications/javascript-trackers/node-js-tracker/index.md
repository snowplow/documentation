The Snowplow Node.js Tracker allows you to track Snowplow events from your Node.js applications.

The tracker should be straightforward to use if you are comfortable with JavaScript development; any prior experience with other Snowplow trackers is helpful but not necessary.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
