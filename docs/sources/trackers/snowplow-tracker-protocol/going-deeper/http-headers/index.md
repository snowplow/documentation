Snowplow Collectors will collect any standard HTTP headers and the values of these headers can be extracted during Enrichment. The [HTTP header extractor enrichment](/docs/enriching-your-data/available-enrichments/http-header-extractor-enrichment/index.md) can be configured for the headers you wish to extract.

Additionally, the following two headers can be sent on requests:

| Header            | Allowed Values     | Description |
|-------------------|--------------------|------------|
| Content-Type      | `application/json` | See [MDN Content-Type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type)        |
| SP-Anonymous      | `*`                | Enables Server Side Anonymization, preventing the User IP Address and Network User ID from being collectoed       |

#### Cookie Header

Snowplow Collectors will collect any cookie information sent in the `Cookie` HTTP header. Cookies can be attached to events using the [Cookie extractor enrichment](/docs/enriching-your-data/available-enrichments/cookie-extractor-enrichment/index.md)
