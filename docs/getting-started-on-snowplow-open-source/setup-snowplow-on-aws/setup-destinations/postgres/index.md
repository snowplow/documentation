Snowplow supports loading data into Postgres.

If you would like to query your enriched Snowplow data in Postgres, you can set up the [Postgres Loader](/docs/pipeline-components-and-applications/loaders-storage-targets/snowplow-postgres-loader/index.md), which can read the data from your enriched Kinesis stream and write it to your Postgres instance.
