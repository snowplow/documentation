By default, Signals calculates attributes in real time, in stream. Stream attributes are ideal for real-time use cases such as tracking the latest video a user played, or the number of page views in a session.

Use the Python SDK to define the attributes you want to calculate, as well as the entities that the attributes relate to. Group them together into a view, and apply this configuration to Signals.

All configuration is defined using the [Signals Python SDK](https://github.com/snowplow-incubator/snowplow-signals-sdk).

## Set up the SDK TODO

First, choose where to store your Signals configurations. We recommend creating a new repository.

The easiest way to use the Python SDK is within a Jupyter notebook. TODO link to example notebook

Within your notebook, install the SDK.

```bash
pip install snowplow-signals
```

### Required connection tokens

To connect to your Signals deployment, you will need 4 values:

- API URL - This will be generated by Snowplow and shared with you
- API Key ID and the corresponding API Key (secret), which are generated from the [credentials section](https://console.snowplowanalytics.com/credentials) in BDP Console.
- The organization ID, which can be retrieved from the URL immediately following the `.com` when visiting BDP Console:

## Stream volume limit

Attributes are configured based on one or more Snowplow event schemas. For stream attributes, calculation is limited to the most recent 100 instances of the specified event(s) in the pipeline.

For example, you could configure a User entity with a `latest_video_played` stream attribute based on the Snowplow media `play_event` event. The 100 event volume window isn't a problem here, as the calculation is always updated with the latest `play_event` for that user. Conversely, for aggregated attributes based on common event types such as page views, the 100 event limit might limit the analytical accuracy.

For these attributes or for analyzing user behavior over longer periods, configuring a batch (warehouse) source is a better fit.

## Batch attributes

To configure attributes based on historical data, see [Calculate from warehouse](/docs/signals/configuration/batch-calculations/index.md). Batch attributes are suitable for longer-term metrics such as a user's purchase history or average session length.
