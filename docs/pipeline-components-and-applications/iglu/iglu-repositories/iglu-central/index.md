[Iglu Central](http://iglucentral.com/) is a public repository of JSON Schemas hosted by Snowplow Analytics.

As far as we know, Iglu Central is the first public **machine-readable** schema repository - all prior efforts we have seen are human-browsable directories of articles about schemas (e.g. [schema.org](http://schema.org/)).

Think of Iglu Central as like [RubyGems.org](http://rubygems.org/) or [Maven Central](http://central.maven.org/) but for storing publically-available JSON Schemas.

## Technical architecture

Under the hood, Iglu Central is built and run as a static Iglu repository, which is simply an Iglu repository server structured as a static website serving its whole content over http, and is hosted on Amazon S3.

The [deployment process](/docs/pipeline-components-and-applications/iglu/iglu-central-setup/index.md) for Iglu Central is documented on this wiki in case a user wants to setup a public mirror or private instance of Iglu Central.

Iglu Central is available for view at [http://iglucentral.com](http://iglucentral.com/). Although Iglu Central is primarily designed to be consumed by [Iglu clients](/docs/pipeline-components-and-applications/iglu/iglu-clients/index.md), the root index page for Iglu Central links to all schemas currently hosted on Iglu Central.

## Self Hosting Iglu Central schemas
