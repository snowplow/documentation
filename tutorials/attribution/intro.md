This tutorial walks you through how to set up Snowplowâ€™s Attribution dbt package. It assumes you have already followed our Snowplow Unified Package [tutorial](/tutorials/unified-digital/intro), or previously configured it, as the Attribution package requires the model outputs (e.g. unified views and conversions tables).

### Prerequisites

- [dbt](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt) installed (and dbt profile configured for Data Warehouse connection)
- have the [Campaign attribution enrichment](/docs/pipeline/enrichments/available-enrichments/campaign-attribution-enrichment/) enabled to generate the marketing campaign fields such as mkt_medium, mkt_source, mkt_term, mkt_content, and mkt_campaign which would be needed for channel and campaign classification to ultimately calculate the appropriate attribution
- have the [Referer parser enrichment](/docs/pipeline/enrichments/available-enrichments/referrer-parser-enrichment/) enabled to extract attribution data from referer URLs
- Snowplow Unified Digital [dbt Package](/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-models/dbt-unified-data-model) configured and run (v0.4.0 or above) it will generate the following source tables for you:
  - `snowplow_unified_views` table as a path (touch points) source
  -  `snowplow_unified_conversions` table as a conversions source including the revenue (generated by the optional conversions module)
  - `snowplow_unified_user_mapping` table as the user mapping source (needed for user stitching)
- (Optional) Marketing Spend Source table. [See more information here](/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-models/dbt-attribution-data-model/#3-channel-spend-information-optional-but-recommended). It will contain your marketing spend data by channel and or campaign with a timestamp field which denotes the period. This is needed for the ROAS calculation within the `snowplow_attribution_overview` model.
