Snowplow offers a large number of enrichments that can be used to enhance your event data. Most enrichments attach data to the event as [entities](/docs/fundamentals/entities/index.md), although some enrichments fill or modify event fields directly.

The order of enrichments is hard-coded and cannot be changed, the below table lists available enrichments in order they are executed.

:::note

It’s not possible to configure more than one instance of the same enrichment except JavaScript enrichment starting with Enrich 4.1.0. It is possible to have multiple JavaScript enrichments starting with Enrich 4.1.0. For all other enrichments, you can still only configure one of each including SQL Query and API Request enrichments.
