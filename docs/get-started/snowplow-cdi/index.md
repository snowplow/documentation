You have two options for setting up Snowplow's [Customer Data Infrastructure](https://snowplow.io/snowplow-cdi/). Your pipeline can be within your own cloud account, or hosted by Snowplow.

## Private Managed Cloud: in your own cloud

Private Managed Cloud is a version of [Snowplow](https://snowplow.io) hosted in your own cloud account (AWS, Azure, or GCP). It enables you to create rich and well-structured data to power your advanced analytics and AI use cases.

:::tip Cloud

Consider [Cloud](#cloud-hosted-by-snowplow) for a faster setup time if you don't wish to host your own cloud infrastructure (besides the data warehouse or lake). See [deployment model](docs/get-started/index.md) for a comparison between Private Managed Cloud and Cloud.

## Cloud: hosted by Snowplow

Cloud is a hosted version of [Snowplow](https://snowplow.io) designed to get your organization up and running and delivering value from behavioral data as quickly as possible. It enables you to create rich and well-structured data to power your advanced analytics and AI use cases.

With Cloud, you don't need to set up any cloud infrastructure yourself. See [deployment model](docs/get-started/index.md) for a comparison between Cloud and Private Managed Cloud.

### Where is the Snowplow pipeline hosted?

All data processed and collected with Snowplow Cloud is undertaken within Snowplow's own cloud account. Data is stored in Snowplow's cloud account for 7 days to provide resilience against potential failures.
