You may wish to track events which are not directly supported by Snowplow and which structured event tracking does not adequately capture. Your event may have more than the five fields offered by `Structured` events, or its fields may not fit into the category-action-label-property-value model. The solution is Snowplow’s self-describing events. Self-describing events are a [data structure based on JSON Schemas](/docs/understanding-your-pipeline/schemas/index.md) and can have arbitrarily many fields.

To define your own custom event, you will need to [create a corresponding schema](/docs/understanding-tracking-design/managing-your-data-structures/index.md). Snowplow uses the schema to validate that the JSON containing the event properties is well-formed.
