## Enterprise: in your own cloud

BDP Enterprise is a version of [Snowplow](https://snowplow.io) hosted in your own cloud account (AWS, Azure or GCP). It enables you to create rich and well-structured data to power your advanced analytics and AI use cases.

:::tip BDP Cloud

Consider [BDP Cloud](#cloud-hosted-by-snowplow) for a faster setup time if you don’t wish to host your own cloud infrastructure (besides the data warehouse or lake). See [deployment model](docs/get-started/index.md) for a comparison between BDP Enterprise and BDP Cloud.
