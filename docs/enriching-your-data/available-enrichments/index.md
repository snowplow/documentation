Snowplow offers a large number of enrichments that can be used to enhance your event data. Most enrichments attach data to the event as [entities](/docs/understanding-your-pipeline/entities/index.md), although some enrichments fill or modify event fields directly.

The order of enrichments is hard-coded and cannot be changed, the below table lists available enrichments in order they are executed.

:::note

Currently, it’s not possible to configure more than one instance of the same enrichment. This is particularly relevant for the JavaScript, SQL Query and API Request enrichments — you can only configure one of each.
