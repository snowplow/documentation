Targets check for [validity and size restrictions](../failure-model/index.md), [batch data](../batching-model/index.md) where appropriate and send data to the destination stream.

You can find more detail on setting up a target, in the [configuration section](/docs/destinations/forwarding-events/snowbridge/configuration/targets/index.md).
