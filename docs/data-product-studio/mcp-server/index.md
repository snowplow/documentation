The Snowplow CLI includes a local Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables natural language interaction with AI assistants like Claude Desktop, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and other MCP-compatible clients for creating, validating, and managing your Snowplow tracking plans. This allows you to:

- Create and validate data structures through conversation
- Analyze tracking requirements and suggest implementations
- Validate data products and source applications

For setup instructions and configuration examples for different MCP clients, see our [MCP tutorial](/tutorials/snowplow-cli-mcp/introduction).
