To access attributes, you need to define a `View` and optionally group multiple views into a `Service`. This guide explains how to define views and services, apply them to your deployment, and retrieve calculated values.


A `View` is a versioned collection of attributes grouped by a common `Entity` (e.g., `session_id` or `user_id`). Once defined, a `View` allows you to retrieve the calculated values of the attributes it contains.

A `Service` is a collection of views that streamlines the retrieval of multiple views. By grouping related views into a `Service`, you can efficiently manage and access user insights, making it easier to personalize applications and analyze behavior.

## Defining a view
You can define a `View` by passing in a list of previously defined attributes. Here's an example:

```python
from snowplow_signals import View, domain_sessionid

my_attribute_view = View(
    name="my_attribute_view",
    version=1,
    entity=domain_sessionid,
    attributes=[
        #Previously defined Attributes
        page_view_count,
        products_added_to_cart_feature,
    ],
    owner="user@company.com",
)
```

## Testing a view
To understand what the output of a `View` will look like, use the `test` method with the `Signals` class. This will output a table of `Attributes` from your `atomic` events table.

```python
# Assuming signals object has been instantiated using the Signals() class

test_data = sp_signals.test(
    view=my_attribute_view,
    app_ids=["website"] # The app id in your Snowplow Events
)

```

## View properties

The `View` has the following properties:


| Argument Name  | Description                                                                                                              | Type           | Default | Required? | For batch only? |

| `name`         | The name of the View                                                                                                     | `string`       |         | yes       |                 |
| `version`      | The version of the View                                                                                                  | `int`          | 1       |           |                 |
| `entity`       | The entity associated with the View                                                                                      | `Entity`       |         | yes       |                 |
| `ttl`          | The amount of time this group of attributes lives. If not specified, the entity's ttl is used or the ttl is not limited. | `timedelta`    |         |           |                 |

| `online`       | Whether online retrieval is enabled (`True`) or not (`False`)                                                            | `bool`         | `True`  |           |                 |
| `offline`      | Whether the View is calculated in the warehouse (`True`) or in real-time (`False`)                                       | `bool`         |         |           | yes             |
| `description`  | The description of the View                                                                                              | `string`       |         |           |                 |
| `tags`         | The metadata of the View                                                                                                 | `dict`         |         |           |                 |
| `owner`        | The owner of the feature view, typically the email of the primary maintainer.                                            | email `string` |         | yes       |                 |
| `fields`       | The list of table columns that are part of this view during materialization.                                             | `Field`        |         |           | yes             |
| `attributes`   | The list of attributes that will be calculated from events as part of this view.                                         | `Attribute`    |         |           |                 |


### View computation types
The method of calculating and serving attributes related to a specific View depends on a specific combination of property values, illustrated in the below matrix:

|                    | Offline = false                      | Offline = true and has attributes                                                      | Offline = True and has no attributes                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Online = false** | Attributes are not computed anywhere | Attributes computed through the Batch Engine in the warehouse but not yet materialized | Table pre-computed without Batch Engine and only in the warehouse     |
| **Online = true**  | Attributes computed in stream        | Attributes computed through the Batch Engine and materialized into Signals             | Table materialized into Signals (if it has a batch source configured) |


## Services
A `Service` groups multiple `Views` together, allowing you to retrieve calculated values from all the `Views` in the `Service`. Here's an example:

```python
from snowplow_signals import Service

my_service = Service(
    name='my_service',
    description='A collection of views',
    views=[
         # Previously defined Views
        my_attribute_view,
        another_view
    ],
    owner="user@company.com",
)

```

## Applying views and services

To begin calculating your `Attributes`, you need to apply the `Views` or `Services` to your `Signals` deployment using the `apply` method:


```python
# Assuming signals object has been instantiated using the Signals() class

sp_signals.apply([
        my_service,
        my_other_service
    ])
```

Once applied, the attributes within these Views and Services will be calculated.


## Stream source

When you apply a `View`, a stream source is automatically created. This source calculates the attributes defined in the `View` in real-time.

Here's an example:
```python
view = View(
    name="view",
    version=1,
    entity=domain_sessionid,
    attributes=[page_view_count],
    owner="user@company.com",
)

sp_signals.apply([view]) #Stream Source created
```

Once applied, the stream source begins calculating the attributes in real-time.


## Retrieving calculated values

To access the calculated values, use the `get_online_attributes` method. Here's an example:

```python
# Assuming signals object has been instantiated using the Signals() class

calculated_values = sp_signals.get_online_attributes(
    source=my_service,
    identifiers="abc-123",
)

print(calculated_values)
```

:::warning
**Note:** While you can filter on specific app_ids during testing, both the streaming and batch engines may be configured to process only a subset of relevant app_ids to avoid unnecessary compute. As a result, testing with an arbitrary app_id may not yield expected data if it isnâ€™t included in the configured subset.
