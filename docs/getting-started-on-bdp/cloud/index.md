# Introduction

BDP Cloud is a hosted version of [Snowplow](https://snowplow.io) designed to get your organization up and running and delivering value from behavioral data as quickly as possible. It enables you to create rich and well-structured data to power your advanced analytics and AI use cases.

With BDP Cloud, you don’t need to set up any cloud infrastructure yourself. See [deployment model](/docs/understanding-your-pipeline/deployment-model/index.md) for a comparison between BDP Cloud and BDP Enterprise.

## Where is the Snowplow pipeline hosted?

All data processed and collected with Snowplow BDP Cloud is undertaken within Snowplow’s own cloud account. Data is stored in Snowplow’s cloud account for 7 days to provide resilience against potential failures.
