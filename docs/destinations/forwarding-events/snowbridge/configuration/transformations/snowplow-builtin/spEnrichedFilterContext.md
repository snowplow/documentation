# spEnrichedFilterContext

`spEnrichedFilterContext`: Filters messages based on a regex match against a field in a context.

This transformation is for use on fileds from contexts.

Note that if the same context is present in the data more than once, one instance of a match is enough for the regex condition to be considered a match — and the message to be kept.

The full parsed context name must be provided, in camel case, in the format returned by the Snowplow analytics SDK: `contexts_{vendor}_{name}_{major version}` — for example `contexts_nl_basjes_yauaa_context_1`.

The path to the field to be matched must then be provided as a jsonpath (dot notation and square braces only) — for example `test1.test2[0].test3`.

Filters can be used in one of two ways, which is determined by the `filter_action` option. `filter_action` determines the behavior of the app when the regex provided evaluates to `true`. If it's set to `"keep"`, the app will complete the remaining transformations and send the message to the destination (unless a subsequent filter determines otherwise). If it's set to `"drop"`, the message will be acked and discarded, without continuing to the next transformation or target.

The below example keeps messages which contain `prod` in the `environment` field of the `contexts_com_acme_env_context_1` context. Note that the `contexts_com_acme_env_context_1` context is attached more than once, if _any_ of the values at `dev` don't match `environment`, the message will be kept.
