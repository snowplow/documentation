In this tutorial you've learned how to use Signals to calculate and serve information about user behavior in near real time.

This is the process workflow:
* Define attributes
* Test definitions
* Apply attribute configurations to Signals
* Retrieve calculated attribute values from the Profiles Store

## Next steps

Here are some ideas for further exploration:
* Try out other entities, e.g. `domain_userid`, to calculate the attributes against
* Define attributes based off other event types
* Retrieve calculated attributes in your real applications
* Explore our other Signals tutorials:
  * [Set up the Signals batch engine](/tutorials/signals-batch-engine/start) for calculating attributes from your warehouse
  * [Score prospects in real time using Signals and ML](/tutorials/signals-ml-prospect-scoring/)
