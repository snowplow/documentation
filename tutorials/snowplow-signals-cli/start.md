---

This guide will help you understand how to use the Snowplow Signals SDK CLI tool to manage your dbt projects and generate data models efficiently.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Python 3.11+ installed
- Snowplow Signals SDK installed
- Valid API credentials:
  - API URL
  - API Key
  - API Key ID
  - Organization ID

## What you'll be doing

This tutorial will guide you through:

1. Setting up your environment and testing API connectivity
2. Initializing dbt projects
3. Generating dbt models and assets
4. Managing and updating your models

## Setting Up Environment Variables

For convenience, you can set up your API credentials as environment variables. This allows you to run commands without specifying credentials each time:

```bash
export SNOWPLOW_API_URL="YOUR_API_URL"
export SNOWPLOW_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
export SNOWPLOW_API_KEY_ID="YOUR_API_KEY_ID"
export SNOWPLOW_ORG_ID="YOUR_ORG_ID"
export SNOWPLOW_REPO_PATH="./my_snowplow_project"
```

Let's get started with testing your connection to the Snowplow Signals services.
