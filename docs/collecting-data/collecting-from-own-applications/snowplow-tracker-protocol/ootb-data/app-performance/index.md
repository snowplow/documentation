We provide two groups out-of-the-box solutions for tracking app performance metrics:

1. Plugins for our Web trackers with automatic performance tracking.
2. Timing events available on most of our trackers for manual tracking.

## Automatic performance tracking on Web

The JavaScript tracker provides plugins that track performance events and context entities automatically.

### Web vitals events

Enables tracking web performance metrics categorized as [Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/).

#### How to track?

Use the [Web vitals plugin for the JavaScript tracker](/docs/collecting-data/collecting-from-own-applications/javascript-trackers/web-tracker/tracking-events/web-vitals/index.md).

#### Modeled data using the snowplow-web dbt package

To process raw web vitals event data, we have included an optional module to model in the [snowplow-web dbt package](/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-models/legacy/dbt-web-data-model/core-web-vitals-module/index.md).

This custom module consists of a series of dbt models which produce the following aggregated models from the raw web vitals events:

Derived table | Table description | 
---|---|---
`snowplow_web_vitals` | Incremental table used as a base for storing core web vital events (first event per page view). | [Docs](https://snowplow.github.io/dbt-snowplow-web/#!/model/model.snowplow_web.snowplow_web_vitals)
`snowplow_web_vital_measurements` | Drop and recompute table to use for visualizations that takes core web vital measurements at the user specified percentile point (defaulted to 75). | [Docs](https://snowplow.github.io/dbt-snowplow-web/#!/model/model.snowplow_web.snowplow_web_vital_measurements)


### Performance navigation timing context entity

This plugin will add Performance Navigation Timing contexts to tracked events.

#### How to track?

Using the [Performance Navigation Timing plugin for the JavaScript tracker](/docs/collecting-data/collecting-from-own-applications/javascript-trackers/web-tracker/tracking-events/timings/index.md).

## Manually tracked timing events

Timing events are self-describing events available across most of our trackers.
They enable you to manually track timing information measured within your app.

### How to track?

1. Using the [JavaScript tracker on Web](/docs/collecting-data/collecting-from-own-applications/javascript-trackers/web-tracker/previous-versions/javascript-tracker-v2/tracking-specific-events/index.md#tracktiming).
