[Snowplow Micro](/docs/testing-debugging/snowplow-micro/what-is-micro/index.md) is a minified version of the Snowplow pipeline that can run on your machine. For a few quick tests, Micro can be a simple alternative to deploying an full-blown Snowplow Open Source pipeline to your cloud. However, note that Micro does not persist the data in any warehouse or database â€” you can only inspect it using the API while Micro is running.

See the [user guide](/docs/testing-debugging/snowplow-micro/index.md) for more information.
