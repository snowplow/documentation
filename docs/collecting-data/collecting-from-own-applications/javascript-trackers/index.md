The Snowplow JavaScript Trackers support being used in a number of environments.

There are currently three trackers:

- **Browser Tracker (v3)** for installation into web apps via npm. Popular when natively integrating tracking into React, Angular and Vue applications.
- **JavaScript Tracker (v2 and v3)** for loading via both synchronous and asynchronous tags, by adding code snippets to your website or Tag Manager solution.
- **Node.js Tracker (v3)** for use in server-side Node.js environments via npm.
